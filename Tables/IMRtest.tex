\midrule\multicolumn{4}{p{10.6cm}}{\begin{footnotesize}\textsc{Notes:} The sample for these regressions consist of all children who have been entirely exposed to the risk of infant mortality (ie those over 1 year of age). Subsamples 2+, 3+, 4+ and 5+ are generated to allow comparison of children born at similar birth orders.  For a full description of these groups see the the body of the paper or notes to tables \ref{TWINtab:IVTwoplus}, \ref{TWINtab:IVThreeplus}, \ref{TWINtab:IVFourplus} or \ref{TWINtab:IVFiveplus} respectively. Treated=1 refers to children who are born before a twin while Treated=0 refers to children of similar birth orders not born before a twin.  Base and S+H controls are described in table \ref{TWINtab:IVTwoplus}.$^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01
