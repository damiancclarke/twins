NOTES: Four-plus refers to all first- to third-born children in families with four or more children.  Each cell presents the coefficient of a 2SLS regression where fertility is instrumented by twinning at birth order four.  Base controls include age, mother's age, and mother's age at birth fixed effects plus country and year-of-birth FEs.  Standard errors are clustered by mother.
