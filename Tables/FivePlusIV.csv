NOTES: Five-plus refers to all first- to fourth-born children in families with five or more children.  Each cell presents the coefficient of a 2SLS regression where fertility is instrumented by twinning at birth order five.  Base controls include child age, mother's age, and mother's age at birth fixed effects plus country and year-of-birth FEs.  The sample is made up of all children aged between 6-18 years from families in the DHS who fulfill five-plus requirements. First-stage results in the final panel correspond to the second stage in row 1.  Full first stage results for each row are available in table 15. Standard errors are clustered by mother.
