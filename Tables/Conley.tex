\midrule\multicolumn{5}{p{11.6cm}}{\begin{footnotesize}\textsc{Notes:} This table presents upper and lower bounds of a 95\% confidence interval for the effects of family size on (standardised) children's education attainment. These are estimated by the methodology of \citet{Conleyetal2012}  under various priors about the direct effect that being from a twin family has on educational outcomes ($\gamma$). In the UCI (union of confidence interval) approach, it is assumed the true $\gamma\in[0,\delta]$, while in the LTZ (local to zero) approach it is assumed that $\gamma\sim U(0,\delta)$.  In each case $\delta$ is estimated by including twinning in the first stage  equation and observing the effect size $\hat\gamma$.  Estimated $\hat\gamma$'s are (respectively for two plus to five plus):   0.1077, 0.0931, 0.0810, 0.0870.\end{footnotesize}}
