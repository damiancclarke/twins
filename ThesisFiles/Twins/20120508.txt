Development economists and (presumably) policy makers are interested in determining whether a larger family size causes lower `quality' off-spring.
Whilst this has been examined reasonably comprehensively using data from developed countries, work in developing countries is scarcer. Testing
of this hypothesis in the developing world is particularly important.  Where family budget constraints are more tightly binding and where public
support programs for young children are less widely available, the conditions for quality-quantity trade-off are particulary plausible.

(5) Simulation - save residual, check whether correlated with twin 

(6) run analysis for rich and poor countries, see how this affects the results.
