MERGING DHS SURVEYS:
(1) first I check which countries and years have observations in both the child dataset (CHILD) and the education dataset (EDUC)
(2) I drop observations in both datasets where the countries do not line up 
	> of the 8,231,924 observations in EDUC 5,321,136 are from countries where surveys are available in CHILD
	> of the 4,232,399 observations in CHILD 2,989,332 are from countries where surveys are available in EDUC
(3) CHILD has observations of various individuals in a household (90% of households have 10 or less individuals).  These individuals
are between the ages of 0-39 (85% are less than 19 years old).  However, within each household individuals are not necessarily siblings.
As far as I can tell, each observation must be a child of somebody in the household.  I have information about the child's mother's
relationship to the household head (eg wife, daughter).  If for example the child's mother is the daughter of the household head,
this suggests that the child is the granddaughter of the household head.  This detail is important as in the EDUC database I have each
member's relationship to the household head. Then, by determining the child's relationship to the head in CHILD (via the mothers relationship)
this is one part of the merge I use to merge with EDUC.

The mother's total fertility (reported by the fertility variable) perfectly matches up to data on each child (but top-coded at 20).  Obviously 
the mother is asked to provide details on all children, and then from this list fertility is calculated (I think I remember seeing a list
format on the questionnaire).  In this way, information in the child database is avaialable on each child of mothers in the household.

(4) EDUC has observations of various individuals in a household (once again 90% have less than 10).  Age ranges from 0 to 97+.  There are
also details regarding the relationship to the household head.

(5) In order to merge, I merge on country, year, household id, relationship to head, sex and age (in this order).  In theory, all children
of the same age and sex with the same relationshop to the household head will be matched across the two datasets.  There are two drawbacks
here.  The first, I can't match all household head relationships as approximately 5% are unknown/ other.  The second, all children of the
same age and same sex (such as twins of the same gender) merge twice.  Fortunately this is not such a hassle as I exclude twins from the
regressions anyway.  The important thing to know is that a household has a twin (a variable that is already available) and at what birth
order this occurred. 

This allows me to match 1,698,362 of the 2,989,332 observations from the CHILD set.  Of these 15,480 are matched twice,  Of those who are matched
twice, the vast majority have the same education figures (75%), with approx 85% having a one year difference between the two matches. The
1,240,891 who aren't matched from the CHILD dataset have the following relationships to household head:

relationship|      Freq.     Percent        Cum.
------------+-----------------------------------
          3 |  1,107,064       89.22       89.22 (head, wife or co-spouse)
          5 |     90,417        7.29       96.50 (daughter, daughter-in-law, adopted child)
          8 |     16,775        1.35       97.85 (mother, mother-in-law)
         10 |     26,635        2.15      100.00 (sister)
------------+-----------------------------------
      Total |  1,240,891      100.00

Note that these are the mother of the child's relation to the household head, so the 1,107,064 are the children of the household head.
