Child Quantity versus Quality: Are Twin Births Exogenous?

The literature on twin studies treats twin birth as an exogenous shock to sibship, and uses this
event as a manner to instrument for the otherwise endogenous parental decision of ideal family size.
This methodology has been popular in examining the child quality-quantity trade-off hypothesis.  Here,
I examine whether multiple birth is exogenous, and find that it is not, responding to factors such as mother's
height and education.  Using the Demographic and Health Surveys I examine the potential size of the
bias introduced using the traditional IV strategy, and run Monte Carlo simluations to determine how the 
magnitude of this bias will vary as the correlation between twinning and mother's characteristics increases.
