Documentation for Data/Programs
"Plausibly Exogenous" by Conley, Hansen, Rossi
Restat, 94, Issue 1 (Feb 2012)

There are four categories of files

Normal Sampler -- contains R programs to implement all Bayesian analysis in the paper
Matlab Code -- contains Matlab code to implement frequentist estimators in the paper
Stata Code -- contains Stata code for the local to zero and union of intervals approaches
401K  -- contains R and Matlab programs and data for the 401K data example
Margarine Data -- contains R and Matlab programs and data for the margarine demand example
Returns to Schooling -- contains R and Matlab programs and data for the Angrist and Krueger returns to schooling example

Each of the application categories contain documentation files for each data set

Note: the R scripts to run the programs on each example must be modified to point to the directory which contains the "Normal Sampler" code if desired.

Results of these programs can be found in Table 2 (all three examples) and figures 1,2,3,4, and 5

The matlab files in each of the 401k, Margarine Data, and Returns to Schooling folders produce the figures.
