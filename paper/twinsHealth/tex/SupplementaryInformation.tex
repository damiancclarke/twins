The supplementary information for ``Twin Births and Maternal Condition'' provides additional details regarding data and estimation methodologies to support the findings in the paper that the likelihood of a twin birth depends positively upon maternal health stocks and health-related behaviours during pregnancy. A full list of DHS survey data and timing is presented in table S1, while tables S2 and S3 provide regression results to accompany figure 4 and extended data figure 4.
