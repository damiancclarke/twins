LITERATURE
The occurrence of twin births is a commonly used for identification in economic
studies.  Specifically, twin births as a shock to total fertility have been used
to motivate the estimation of the quantity-quality trade-off 
\citep{RosenzweigWolpin1980,Blacketal2005,Angristetal2010,Caceres2006}, the 
effects of childbearing on female labour force participation 
\citep{RosenzweigWolpin1980b,Jacobsenetal1999,AngristEvans1998}, and the effects 
of unwed childbearing on marriage market outcomes, poverty and welfare receipt 
\citep{BronarsGrogger1994}.\footnote{Twins have been widely used in the economic, 
medical, biology and psychology literature in a number of ways.  In this paper we 
focus only on the use of twin births as an instrument for total fertility, and 
not on the so called `twin studies', which base inference on between-twin 
comparisons using maternal fixed effects.}

The methodology employed in all of these studies requires that twinning be (at 
least conditionally) exogenous.  Typically then, the previous literature has made 
one of a series of assumptions.  The earliest twin studies of the Q-Q trade-off 
\citep{RosenzweigWolpin1980,RosenzweigWolpin1980b} pointed out that twinning 
is both a positive function of total parity, and of maternal age.  By focusing
on twins at first birth and conditioning on maternal age, they thus produced 
consistent estimates of the tradeoff under the assumption that beyond maternal 
age and parity, twin births were entirely random.  A more recent wave of studies 
including \citet{Blacketal2005,Caceres2006,Lietal2008,Angristetal2010} take this 
one step further, assuming that twinning is conditionally exogenous after 
controlling for additional family characteristics such as a mother's race and her 
educational attainment.  They thus condition on a mother's age, race, and 
education, as well as on the birth order of the child in first and second stage 
regressions.

In some cases the validity of such assumptions is probed by regressing twinning
on observable family outcomes, or testing for the equality of means of certain 
characteristics between twin and non-twin families. \citet{Blacketal2005}, 
\citet{Lietal2008} and \citet{Sanhueza2009} report joint $F$-tests suggesting that
twinning is not related to parental education in their data samples, while 
\citet{RosenzweigZhang2009} report $t$-tests showing equality of means across twin 
and non-twin groups. However, as is well known and acknowledged in each case, any 
such tests are at best partial evidence in support of instrumental validity.  While 
twins can be shown to be unrelated to observable or measured characteristics, 
similar tests cannot be run for variables which are either unobservable, or not 
recorded in survey data. We return to this point in the following sections.

Finally, recent studies aim to control for the fact that multiple births are 
correlated with fertility treatments.  Typically such a treatment requires either 
focusing on offspring born before the introduction of fertility treatments 
\citep{Caceres2006, Angristetal2010}, or, in the case of sufficiently rich data, 
removing families undergoing fertility treatment from estimation samples 
\citep{Braakman2014}.  Once again, consistent estimation in this case is based
on the assumption that beyond fertility treatment and family controls listed 
above, twin births are as good as random.

Critiques of the twin instrument have focused on parental behaviours in response
to twins, rather than on the likelihood that parental behaviours (or endowments)
may affect the likelihood of twinning.  \citet{RosenzweigZhang2009}  question the
effect that close (or indeed no) birth spacing and an endowment effect---where 
parental behaviours respond to the lower health at birth of twins compared to single 
births\footnote{Using data from the United States, \citet{Almondetal2005} document 
that twins have substantially lower birth weight, lower APGAR scores, higher use of 
assisted ventilation at birth and lower gestion period than singletons.}---has on 
investments in pre-twin siblings.  They demonstrate that if parents behave in such
a manner, bounds for the Q-Q trade-off can be calculated.  This hypothesis is 
tested in \citet{Angristetal2010}, and applied in \citet{FitzsimonsMalde2010}.



%REMOVED.  SHOULD MAKE THIS POINT MORE EXTENSIVELY IN INTRO.
%Previous twin literature has not controlled for maternal health variables which
%may increase the likelihood of live twin births.  There is, however, considerable
%evidence that maternal health and maternal behaviours during pregnancy have a 
%substantial effect on birth and later life outcomes \citep{Almondetal2011,
%BhalotraRawlings2013,Barker1995}.  As we will discuss in the coming sections,

DATA

The data used here come from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).  The DHS 
are a set of nationally representative surveys which have been administered in 
low- and middle-income countries between 1985 and the present.  Women aged 
between 15--49 in surveyed households respond to an in-depth series of questions 
reporting their full fertility history (listing all surviving and non-surviving 
children), their actual and desired contraceptive use and number of births, 
education level, marital status, plus the measurement of a number of health 
endowments such as height and body mass index.  For all other members living in 
the household a shorter series of responses are recorded, including the 
individual's educational attainment.

This results in two distinct sets of data to be merged.  One database contains
one line for each birth reported by every 15--49 year-old woman surveyed with
a limited number of child-level covariates such as the child's date of birth,
type of birth (single or multiple), and the child's survival status.  The other
database contains one line for each member currently living in the survey 
household.  This database includes each member's educational status.  By 
crossing these two databases we are thus able to generate data for the
educational attainment of each of a woman's children currently residing in the 
household as well as their mother's health and educational status.  This 
database is thus selected in two ways: firstly it only contains children who
have survived up until the survey date, and secondly it only contains children
who have remained living in the same household as their mother.  In order to
ensure that this sample is as representative as possible, we restrict our
analysis to those children aged 18 and under.

We pool all publicly available DHS data resulting in microdata on 6,697,397 
ever-born children.  A full list of the DHS countries and years of surveys which
make up this sample is provided as appendix table \ref{TWINtab:countries}.  Of 
the 6,697,397 offspring reported in survey data, 3,803,796 remain living in the 
same household as their mother.  The majority of these 3,803,796 children are 
aged 18 and under (91.45\%) and hence make up our principal estimation sample (in 
future we will refer to this as the `household sample').  The remaining 2,893,601 
offspring were not recorded as living in the same household as their mother.  Of 
these children \emph{not} in the household, and hence for whom education is not 
recorded, the majority (51.8\%) were aged over 18 or had died prior to the date 
of survey.\footnote{Children aged under 18 who are alive but not living in the 
same household as their mother are statistically quite different to those 
children who do remain in the household.  In our data sample, they are on average 
2 years older, born to less educated and older mothers, and are slightly less 
likely to be males or twins.}

ESTIMATION SAMPLES

We work with a number of estimation samples.  For tests in which twinning is the 
outcome variable of interest, our sample consists of all children who remain 
living in the household with their mother, and hence for whom we have full 
covariates.  For tests in which child death is the outcome, we use the full 
sample of under 18 year-olds, whether or not they remain in the household of 
their mother.  Such a sample is necessary given that children who died prior to 
the date of the survey no longer appear in our household sample.

In all tests of the Q-Q trade-off using twins, we follow existing literature in 
defining birth-order-specific estimation samples conditional on the total number 
of a mother's births. These samples are referred to as the 2+, 3+, 4+ and 5+ 
samples.  These samples are defined $\forall\ n \in \{2,3,4,5\}$ such that they 
include first-born to $n-1$ born children in families with at least $n$ births.%
\footnote{Existing studies such as \citet{Angristetal2010} focus mainly on the 2+ 
and 3+ samples.  Given the higher fertility in the DHS data, we also include 
higher birth-order groups.}  As an example, the 2+ sample consists of first-borns 
in families with at least two births, and the 3+ sample consists of first- and 
second-borns in families with at least 3 births.  Such a sample decision is 
important when estimating the Q-Q trade-off using twinning as an instrument.  
Given that family size is endogenously chosen by parents and rates of twin birth
are not constant by birth-order, twin-births will occur more frequently in 
families that have a higher fertility preference. This point is addressed by 
(among others) \citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980} and \citet{Blacketal2005} who first 
suggested combining $n$+ groups with twinning at birth order $n$ as a way to 
ensure that twin and non-twin families in the sample would have similar fertility 
preferences.

Table \ref{TWINtab:Samples} presents the sample size along with basic descriptives 
for each of the samples.  Full descriptives are provided in the sub-section which 
follows. For each of the 2+ to 5+ samples we only focus on children aged over six 
given that our outcome of interest requires the child to have (at least) reached
primary-school age.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Table \ref{TWINtab:sumstats} provides summary statistics of this data. Fertility 
and maternal characteristics are described at the level of the mother, while 
child education and survival are described at the level of the child (the 
education and full samples respectively).  The number of observations at each 
level is provided at the bottom of the table.

Survey countries are classified according to country income level in order to 
allow for a disaggregation of Q-Q results by income group.\footnote{This 
classification is obtained from the World Bank, with DHS surveyed countries 
falling into two broad groups based on their GNI per capita at the moment of the 
DHS survey.  These groups consist of countries classed as low-income economies, 
and countries classed as middle-income economies (either lower-middle or 
upper-middle). Details regarding this classification can be found in Appendix 
Table \ref{TWINtab:countries}.}  We present summary statistics by birth type
(singleton or twin), and by country income status.  Twin births make up 1.85\% 
of all births.  A simple comparison of means suggests that healthy mothers (as 
proxied by height, BMI and probability of being underweight) are more likely to 
give birth to twins, and that twin births are more likely to occur in low-income
countries.  This apparent contradiction can be explained given that twins are
(both mechanically and biologically) a positive function of fertility, and 
fertility is higher in the low-income sample.  Figure \ref{TWINfig:bord} 
describes this positive relationship: while twins account for less than 1\% of 
all first-borns, they account for greater than 4\% of all tenth-born children.
As expected, twin families are larger than non-twin families. Figure 
\ref{TWINfig:births} describes total fertility in twin and non-twin families.  
The distribution of family size in families where at least one twin birth has 
occurred dominates the corresponding distribution for all-singleton families.  
This is expected given imperfect fertility control and---even were fertility 
perfectly controlled by families---given that some twins will occur on a family's 
final desired birth.  Such a result is required for instrumental relevance when
using twining to estimate a Q-Q trade-off.

Child `quality' is measured using each child's educational attainment.  Our
principal outcome variable is a standarised score for schooling (Z-Score). This
Z-Score is calculated by comparing each child's total years of completed 
education to his or her birth cohort in their country of residence.  This allows
us to express all effect-sizes in terms of a one standard deviation increase 
in total educational attainment.

METHODOLOGY
Typically, empirical analyses of the quality-quantity trade-off focus on 
producing consistent estimates of $\beta_1$ in the following specification:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:secondstage}
educ_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 fert_{j} + \bm{X}\bm{\beta}_2+u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Here, quality is proxied by the educational attainment of child $i$ in family 
$j$, ($educ$) and fertility ($fert$) is measured as the total births in a child's
family.  A vector of family and child controls is included, denoted $\bm{X}$.  As
has been extensively discussed in prior literature, estimation of $\beta_1$ using
OLS and cross-sectional data will result in biased coefficients given that child 
quality and quantity are jointly determined \citep{BeckerLewis1973,BeckerTomes1976}, 
and given that unobservable parental behaviours and attributes influence both 
fertility decisions, and investments in children's education \citep{Qian2009}.

QUANTITY-QUALITY WITH TWINS
As a result, 2SLS estimation is employed, where fertility is instrumented using
twin births.\footnote{Other instruments and methodologies are also used 
including gender mix of children \citep{Angristetal2010}, policy experiments 
\citep{Qian2009}, and historical time series variation in schooling 
\citep{BleakleyLange2009}}  The corresponding first stage is:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:firststage}
fert_{j}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 twins_{j}+\bm{X}\bm{\alpha}_2+\nu_{j},
\end{equation}
where $twins_j$ is an indicator for whether the $n^{th}$ birth in a family is a 
twin birth. As described in section \ref{TWINsscn:samples}, the sample in each 
case is the so-called $n+$ group, consisting of children born before birth $n$ 
in families with at least $n$ births.  As such the twins themselves are excluded 
from the estimation sample.\footnote{Typically, the argument is made that twins 
are different to single births, and hence should not be compared in analysis}
As an alternative specification we do include children from the $n^{th}$ birth 
(twins in twin families), however generally focus on the typical $n+$ sample as
our principal sample.

Consistent estimation of $\hat\beta_1$ can thus proceed provided (among other
things) that instrumental validity holds:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:IVvalid}
P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju_{ij}=0 
\end{equation}
Given the unobservable nature of the error term $u$, we are unable to test 
(\ref{TWINeqn:IVvalid}).  There is however nothing which stops us from 
partially testing (\ref{TWINeqn:IVvalid}) by removing a subset of observable
components from $u$.  The error term $u$ in (\ref{TWINeqn:secondstage}) is a 
function of a large number of elements:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:IVbias}
\begin{split}
u=f(\text{maternal health, fertility behaviour, positive pregnancy investments,}  \\
\text{parental education, negative pregnancy investments,}\ldots)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for now we do not specify the signs on any of these variables.  While many of 
the relevant elements are either completely or partially unobservable to the 
econometrician, some of these variables, such as maternal education and health
can be measured.  Thus a partial test of the twin methodology consists of 
estimating the following regression.
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twinreg}
twin_{j}=\gamma_0 + \bm{X}\bm{\gamma}_1 + \bm{S}\bm{\gamma}_2
                  + \bm{H}\bm{\gamma}_3 + \varepsilon_{j}.
\end{equation}
Here $\bm{X}$ refers to the initial vector of family and child controls, $\bm{S}$
to additional family socioeconomic variables such as income and parental 
education, and $\bm{H}$ to maternal health variables.  

If twin birth is indeed an event which is as good as random, the coefficients
on maternal health and family socieoeconomic variables in the above regression
should not be significantly different to zero.  We thus test the following 
hypothesis in our DHS data:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twintest}
H_0: \bm{\gamma}_2 = \bm{\gamma}_3 = 0.
\end{equation}
Rejection of the null would raise difficulties in proceeding with IV estimation 
using the twin instrument.  Of course, if the rejection of the null were only due 
to one or a number of \emph{observable} element(s) which predicted twinning, 
these variables could simply be included in the first and second stages above, 
much like occurs with maternal age and race in the existing literature.  However, 
more generally it would be difficult to be argue for instrumental validity if 
twinning is shown to depend upon (a limited set of) measurable family 
characteristic or choice variables, while many similar variables are not observed.

Given the biological demands placed on a mother pregnant with twins, we may 
expect that healthier mothers, or mothers with more resources to invest in their
pregnancy are more likely to take twin conceptions to term.  Similarly, we may
suspect that mothers more able to invest their pregnancy will also be more able
to invest in their child's human capital after birth.  If this is the case, we
would see that (at the very least) $\bm{\gamma_2}>0$.

If we assume additive separability of the elements in the omitted error term, we
can re-write $u_{ij}$ from (\ref{TWINeqn:firststage}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:IVbias}) 
as:
\[ u_{ij}=u^S_{ij}+u^H_{ij}+u^*_{ij}. \]
Here $u^S_{ij}$ and $u^H_{ij}$ correspond to the identical (observable) elements
included as $\bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ in (\ref{TWINeqn:twinreg}), while $u^*_{ij}$
represent the remaining (unobserved) components.  We can thus re-write our IV
estimate for $\beta_1$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:betabias}
\hat\beta_1^{IV} = \beta_1 + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^S_{ij} + 
P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^H_{ij} + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^*_{ij}
\end{equation}
Typically, this is the coefficient estimated in the existing twin literature 
which assumes that twinning is a conditionally exogenous event.  If, however, the 
likelihood of taking twin conceptions to term increases for healthier and/or 
wealthier mothers, we should include $\bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ in the first and 
second stages, giving
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:betacloser}
\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H} = \beta_1 + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^*_{ij},
\end{equation}
where the superscript $S+H$ signifies that socioeconomic and health variables 
have been included as additional controls.  What's more, if both the likelihood
that a family takes twins to term and a family's investment in child human capital 
are positively correlated with positive health behaviours and other positive 
socioeconomic variables such as parental education, we would expect that:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.
\]
It should be noted in the above series of inequalities that even conditional upon
socioeconomic and health variables, IV estimation will \emph{not} result in a
consistent estimate of $\beta_1$ if twinning is correlated with unobservable
elements in $u^*_{ij}$.  We return to this point, and how to bound $\beta_1$ in
the following sub-section.

BOUNDING THE Q-Q TRADEOFF
%Description of methodology of \citet{Altonjietal2005} perhaps?

In the previous subsection, Q-Q estimation using twins is motivated in equations 
(\ref{TWINeqn:secondstage}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:firststage}).  Consistent IV
estimation imposes the (strong) prior belief that twin births can be excluded 
from the second stage equation, or that the sign of $\gamma$ in the following 
is equal to zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:Conley}
Quality_{ij}=\beta fert_j + \gamma twin_j + u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
As we discuss above, this will not be the case if maternal health controls 
omitted from (\ref{TWINeqn:secondstage}) are correlated with both the 
likelihood of taking twin conceptions to term, and with eventual measures of 
child quality.

However, even in cases such as this where we are not confident that $\gamma=0$,
we can still estimate bounds on the Q-Q tradeoff if we are confident in making
some statement of prior belief about the distribution from which $\gamma$ is 
drawn.  \citet{Conleyetal2012} describe such a process, which they refer to as 
\emph{plausible exogeneity}.  We invoke this terminology here, and refer to 
twins as a plausibly exogenous event, implying that we have reason to believe 
that $\gamma$ may be close to, but not necessarily precisely equal to, zero.

In this paper we estimate $\beta$ under a range of assumptions regarding the
true nature of $\gamma$.  Firstly we estimate $\beta$ by simply assuming a
support assumption for $\gamma$: specifically that $\gamma$ falls between 
zero (implying instrumental validuty) and some (positive) number $\delta$:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:uci}
\gamma \in [0,\delta].
\end{equation}
This is a relatively weak assumption, however, as \citet{Conleyetal2012} show,
it allows for us to recover a `union of confidence intervals' (hereafter UCI) 
for estimates of $\beta$ over the entire support of $\gamma$.  This UCI, then, 
provides bounds for $\beta$ even in the case that twin exogeneity does not 
strictly hold. We also estimate 
by imposing a stronger prior: specifically we fully specify the distribution of
$\gamma$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:ltz}
\gamma \sim U(0,\delta).
\end{equation}
This stronger assumption allows for a tighter estimate of the bounds on $\beta$.
\citet{Conleyetal2012} provide a full derivation of this result, and we follow
them in referring to this as a local-to-zero (LTZ) approximation.

Assumptions (\ref{TWINeqn:uci}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:ltz}) depend upon the values
of $\delta$ which we believe hold in the case of twinning and the Q-Q equation.
As such, we estimate both specifications over a wide range of values for 
$\delta$, however our preferred values (those which we present in tables in this 
paper) are that $\gamma \in [0,2\hat\gamma]$ and $\gamma \sim U(0,2\hat\gamma)$.
We thus first estimate $\hat\gamma$ by running the structural equation 
(\ref{TWINeqn:Conley}), and then plug these estimates back into the 
\citeauthor{Conleyetal2012} plausibly exogenous approach to estimate bounds for
$\beta$.

RESULTS
> TWIN EXOGENEITY
Table \ref{TWINtab:comp} presents a test of balance of maternal characteristics
between mothers who have and who have not given birth to twins.  This table
presents a comparison of means, and a two-tailed $t$-test of the null that 
mothers of twins are not statistically different from mothers of non-twins.
These comparisons suggest that twin mothers are older at the moment of birth,
begin child-bearing earlier, have more children, and are more (less) likely to
come from top (bottom) wealth quintiles.  These comparisons of means, however,
are not surprising given the well established fact that twins occur with higher
frequency as mothers age, and at higher parities \citep{Hall2003}. Given that
mother's who have more births (and hence who are more likely to have twins) are
different in other dimensions, these tests may capture the effect of selection
into higher fertility, rather than twinning itself.  It is, however, worth 
pointing out that table \ref{TWINtab:comp} suggests that healthier mothers as
proxied by height and body mass index (BMI) are unconditionally more likely to 
have twins.  Similar comparisons of all births suggest that healthier mothers
on average have less births.

In order to examine partial correlations, we regress a child's twin status
(1 if a twin, 0 otherwise) on their mother's health, education, and a range
of other demographic and family characteristics.\footnote{In our principal
specification, the full set of controls are country, child year of birth, and
age dummies; a cubic function of mother's age at time of birth; mother's age
at time of first birth; mother's education and education squared; and mother's
height and BMI.  We cluster standard errors at the level of the mother.}  In 
table \ref{TWINtab:twinreg1} we report the results from specification 
(\ref{TWINeqn:twinreg}). These results suggest that twin births are not random, 
even after conditioning on maternal age and child birth order as is typical in 
recent twin literature. The inclusion of a full set of country and year-of-birth 
dummies (not displayed in table \ref{TWINtab:twinreg1}) will capture any 
systematic trend in the frequency of twin births across time or regions, and 
country dummies will absorb all time invariant differences in the probability 
of a twin birth across countries.  The estimated coefficients and signs support 
the idea discussed in section \ref{TWINscn:method} that higher `investments' 
(for example in maternal health) required to maintain multiple healthy fetuses 
\emph{in utero} may result in non-random twin births. Initially results from the 
pooled DHS data are presented as this provides a particularly large sample with 
which to test the hypothesis of twin exogeneity.  This is represented in table 
\ref{TWINtab:twinreg1} column (1) and provides considerable evidence that live 
multiple births respond to family `choice' variables such as education (tests 
for the joint significance of both socioeconomic variables and health variables 
are rejected with p-values of 0.0000).

These results are robust to all alternative specifications examined. Significant
and quantitatively similar results are found if a logit model is estimated 
rather than a linear probability model, and when running separate models for 
twinning at each birth order.  Similarly, if we run the regression at the level
of the mother or include any combination of fertility measures, similar 
patterns are observed.

The fact that maternal health is correlated with twinning is supported by 
medical literature, although is not a point which has been incorporated into 
prior economic studies of twinning.  \citet{Hall2003} for example suggests that 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is associated with an increased likelihood 
of twinning, and is found in higher concentrations in older, heavier and taller 
mothers.  Further, she suggests ``that adequate maternal folic acid consumption 
could affect the number of twins coming to term'' (see p.\ 741, and further 
discussion in \citet{Lietal2003}).  Given that twinning also increases in cases 
where the mother undergoes fertility treatment, we run a similar regression for 
children born in a period not potentially affected by IVF.\footnote{In order to 
be conservative, we estimate for the period preceeding 1990, the date which 
coincides with the first reported successful use of IVF in South Africa, an 
early-adopter among DHS countries.}  These results are included in columns (4) 
and (5).  Pre- and post-1990 results are qualitatively similar although education 
is no longer significant prior to 1990 (in the smaller sample). Mother's height 
and weight, and family socioeconomic variables remain economically and 
statistically significant.

If the reason non-random twin births are observed is due to insufficient investment 
in the developing fetus, it seems likely that twin `selection' will be more 
pronounced in lower income settings, and settings where the mother is less well 
resourced during gestation.  This is tested in columns (2) and (3), where it is 
shown that the violation of the twin exclusion restriction is particularly strong 
in low income countries.  Here maternal health is a more important predictor, and 
the explained portion of this set of variables is larger that in middle-income 
countries.\footnote{The low $R^2$ in these regressions is not at all surprising 
given that twin conception can be thought of as an approximately random process.
The fact that socioeconomic and health variables have \emph{any} power in 
explaining twin birth however is sufficient to invalidate IV estimations if these 
or other relevant predictors are not controlled for.} Finally, we add measures for 
the availability of prenatal care (for the subset of children for whom this variable 
is recorded).  The omitted case are those who report prenatal care from relatives
or traditional health care providers.  We find evidence to suggest that those 
receiving prenatal care from a doctor are more likely to give live birth to twins,
and those who receive no prenatal care are less likely to twin.  We treat these
results with precaution however, given that accessing prenatal care is a choice
variable, and likely endogenous.

These results call into question the veracity of the conditional exogeneity (or 
`as good as random') assumption regarding twin births required to estimate 
$\beta_1$ consistently in (\ref{TWINeqn:secondstage}).  This implies that omitting 
factors such as family socioeconomic and maternal health variables is likely to 
result in inconsistent IV estimates if these variables are also correlated with 
child `quality' outcomes.  It seems unlikely, furthermore, that controlling for 
the factors that we have shown to predict twinning will allow us to recover 
consistent IV estimates.  Maternal health stocks are both difficult to measure, 
and multi-dimensional in nature.\footnote{In ongoing work, we find that the 
probability of twinning falls with maternal alcohol consumption, smoking, drug 
taking and a range of other behaviours in data from the USA, Chile, UK and 
Scotland.}  In the following subsections we examine the effect that omitting these
factors is likely to have on IV estimates of the Q-Q trade-off.

As is typically found in empirical studies of the Q-Q tradeoff, correlations 
between family size and child outcome variables are negative, and strongly 
significant. Table \ref{TWINtab:OLS} shows OLS estimates of child `quality' on
total fertility. These results suggest that an additional sibling is associated
with an approximatelty 0.1 sd decrease in standardised schooling outcomes.

Of course, this empirically observed relationship between the quantity of an 
individual's siblings and their measured `quality' does not necessarily imply 
that such a trade-off exists if parental decisions regarding the production of 
child quality and quantity are jointly made and possibly influenced by unobserved
factors \citep{BeckerTomes1976}.  Principally here we are concerned with 
unobserved parental behaviours which may favour both lower family size and higher 
child quality.  The OLS results are consistent with such a result, as the 
inclusion of maternal education and maternal health controls---likely correlated 
with desires for smaller family size and higher investments per child---reduce the 
magnitude of this observed trade-off.

TWINNING AND QUANTITY-QUALITY
\subsubsection{Q-Q Tradeoff: Estimates Using Twin Births}
Rather than focusing on OLS estimates which are likely to be biased, we turn 
to estimates which rely on twin births to identify the Q-Q tradeoff.  As we 
outline in section \ref{TWINsscn:twinRes}, the assumption of `as good as random' 
twin births is unlikely to hold, even when conditioning on the augmented set of 
controls proposed in (\ref{TWINeqn:twinreg}).  If this is the case, we will 
also be unable to consistently estimate $\beta_1$ using twin births.

However, it is likely that the $\beta_1$ that we estimate using twin births will 
provide us with a strict lower bound of the magnitude of the Q-Q trade-off as
outlined in (\ref{TWINsscn:methodQQ}). We expect that the bias in this estimate 
is due to those mothers who invest more in their children in utero, or who have
greater initial health endowments, being more likely to give birth to twins 
resulting in larger family sizes.  At the same time, we expect healthier mothers 
to invest more in their children after birth resulting in higher quality children.
By relegating health variables to the error term, these two positive correlations 
will result in a positive bias on the fertility coefficient estimated via IV.  In 
order to determine the effect that these omitted variables have on estimates of 
the Q-Q trade-off, we turn to results for equation (\ref{TWINeqn:secondstage}), 
both first omitting, and the including, maternal health and socioeconomic 
variables.

We present IV estimates of the Q-Q trade-off in table \ref{TWINtab:IVAll}.  The 
main specification is displayed in the top row with separate columns for the 2+, 
3+ and 4+ sample groups.  In each case the base case (controlling for maternal 
and child age, country, and year of birth) results in insignificant, and at times 
weakly positive, estimates of the effect of an additional birth on a child's
educational attainment.  These results suggest that the inclusion of maternal 
health and socioeconomic controls may be of considerable importance.  Despite
the lack of results when using the `typical' set of twin controls, including 
health (columns 2, 4 and 6) reduces point estimates on fertility from an effect
of approximately 0\% of a standard deviation, to $-3$ or $-4$\% of a standard 
deviation in standardised educational attainment.  Further, conditioning on
maternal education results in slightly more precise estimates, suggesting a
statistically significant\footnote{Or close to statistically significant in the 
case of the 2+ sample.} Q-Q trade-off of at least 3 or 4\%.

\subsubsection{Heterogeneity of the Q-Q Trade-off}
Estimates of the Q-Q trade-off are heterogeneous across birth orders, country 
income level, and gender of the child affected by the additional birth.  Such a 
result is not surprising if parents perceive that returns to education vary for 
different children or in different circumstances, and invest in human capital in 
line with this.  

The magnitude and significance of the results is lowest when considering the 
effect on the first-born child of moving from two to three births (the 2+ group), 
and higher when considering moving from three to four births or four to five 
births.  However, in lower fertility environments the effect is, as expected, 
concentrated on lower birth orders. The third row of table \ref{TWINtab:IVAll} 
suggests that in middle-income countries that the effect is largest on first 
borns, and progressively smaller, but still considerable, at higher birth orders.

Estimates of the magnitude of the Q-Q trade-off by country income level suggest
that the trade-off is considerably larger in \emph{middle} rather than low-income
countries.  In low-income countries point estimates on fertility suggest 
(insignificant) trade-offs centred around 2-3\% of a standard deviation, while 
in middle-income countries results are significant, and considerably larger,
reaching as much as 9\% of a standard deviation: only slightly lower than OLS
estimates for this group. [ADD TEST HERE LOOKING AT COSTS OF EDUCATION?  HIGHER

Similarly, effects of the Q-Q trade-off are considerably different depending
upon a child's gender.  In table \ref{TWINtab:IVgend} we present specifications 
estimated separately by the gender of the index child.  These results suggest
that females may bear the brunt of additional births, with estimates being 
negative and significant for girls, while insignificant for boy children.  Such 
a result suggests that parents may engage in redistributory behaviour.  This 
idea has been extensively studied by \citet{RosenzweigZhang2009}, however their 
analysis focuses on the possibility that parents reinforce positive birth 
endowments based on child health, not based on child gender as we find here.

In order for the results we produce to be comparable to recent literature we
thus far have only focused on children \emph{preceding} twins.  As an 
alternative specification we also include the $n^{th}$ birth in the analysis
sample.\footnote{In the case of of the 2+ group we thus compare first and 
second born children from families which did not have a twin at the second
birth to first and second born children from families which did have a twin
at the second birth.}  Given the lower birth endowments of twins (and potential
that reinforcing behaviour moves resources away from twins as per 
\citet{RosenzweigZhang2009}), we expect to see that the trade-off is 
significantly stronger when including twins in the sample.  These results are 
displayed in the final row table \ref{TWINtab:IVAll}, and suggest that, if we 
focus not just on pre-twins, that the trade-off of an additional birth is large: 
on the order of 5-8\% of a standard deviation. Finally, in row 4 of the table
we perform an alternative consistency check.  Rather than using the full 
fertility reported by a family, we adjust birth order and fertility to only 
account for those children who survived beyond 1 year of age.  Once again, we 
find that the estimated Q-Q trade-off is larger, and of similar magnitude to 
the results when including twin births.  However, given that child survival 
could itself be thought of as a `quality' variable, it is not clear that this
result is representative of the entire population of children.  Like the results
based on twins and pre-twins, this result, while interesting, is less
conservative than our main specification.

ESTIMATION Q-Q BOUNDS
The results from the previous subsection provide consistent estimates of 
$\beta_1$ via 2SLS \emph{if} the full set of controls completely account for 
those characteristics and behaviours which predict giving live birth to twins.  
However, given that we have shown that twinning is predicted by a wide range
of health behaviours, and given that maternal health variables in this dataset
are limited, it seems unlikely that all relevant variables are included in
these specifications.  As such, we turn to \citeauthor{Conleyetal2012}'s
(\citeyear{Conleyetal2012}) methodology to estimate bounds for the Q-Q trade-off.

As described in section \ref{TWINsscn:methodBounds}, this involves the 
definition of some prior over the sign that the twin instrument takes in the 
structural equation \ref{TWINeqn:Conley}.  Results are displayed in figures 
\ref{TWINfig:ltz2} and \ref{TWINfig:ltz3}, and in table \ref{TWINtab:Conley}.
At each point on the horizontal axis of figures \ref{TWINfig:ltz2} and 
\ref{TWINfig:ltz3}, the bounds for $\beta_1$ are displayed, along with the
corresponding point estimate under the assumption that $\gamma$ is distributed
$U(0,\delta)$.  Dashed lines present the 95\% confidence interval, while the
solid line represents the point estimate.

Table \ref{TWINtab:Conley} provides these bounds at a particular point on this
graph.  This point corresponds to an assumption of $\gamma \in [0,2\hat\delta]$
and $\gamma\sim U(0,2\hat\delta)$ for the UCI and the LTZ approaches respectively,
where $\hat\delta$ is estimated from equation \ref{TWINeqn:Conley} with DHS data.
These results allow us to make informative statements about the Q-Q trade-off,
as the entire bounds for $\beta_1<0$ for 2+, 3+ and 4+ estimates.  Further, these 
results suggest that the magnitude of this trade-off may be large: and indeed 
larger than those estimated in many existing studies.  For example, the effect of 
an additional child at birth order three on first- and second-born children (ie 
the 3+ group) has an effect between -1.5\% to as much as -15\% of a standard 
deviation in standardised educational attainment if the prior (based on DHS 
estimates) is true.  While it is not the case that informative statements can 
always be made given the wide bound on estimates in some cases (particularly the 
five plus group), it is important to point out that in each case as the 
twin-exogeneity assumption is loosened, the point estimate of the Q-Q tradeoff 
becomes more (and considerably) negative.
