\section{Data Appendix}
\label{TWINscn:dataApp}
Main IV and OLS results for this paper are based on DHS and NHIS data described
in section \ref{TWINscn:data}.  These data are downloaded directly off the web
and merged to form the estimation samples of interest. For DHS data, we use two
surveys: the Individual (woman) Recode (IR), and the Household Recode (HR)
providing education for each household member.  For NHIS data, we merge three
of the datafiles made available by the CDC: familyxx, household, and person.
In each case, full generating code for this process is made available on the
authors' websites.  This code downloads, merges and cleans DHS and NHIS data to
produce the datasets (one line per child) used in analysis.

In auxiliary regressions examining the characterstics of mothers and the
relationship these characteristics and twin births and miscarriage, we consult
a large number of other datasets.  These are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item United States National Vital Statistics Birth Data
\item United States National Vital Statistics Fetal Death Data
\item Spanish Vital Statistics (INE)
\item The Swedish Medical Birth Register
\item Scottish Vital Statistics
\item Longitudinal Early Life Survey, Chile (ELPI)
\end{itemize}

In the case of the first 5 datasets (administrative records of births and/or
fetal deaths), we use all recorded instances, focusing on twins as our
outcome variable of interest.  Depending upon the data source, we use all
available measures of pre-determined maternal health stocks or family
socioeconomic indicators.  The ELPI survey from Chile focuses on child early
life, and records mother's behaviours before, during and after pregnancy,
along with child birth outcomes.  We use all children from the first wave of
this survey to run the twin regression included in the appendix tables.
Further notes regarding each dataset and the particular years and number of
births can be found in the notes to each table.

\section{Resampling and Simulation Based Estimation of $\gamma$}
\label{ATWINscn:gammaSim}
\subsection{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}
The methodology to estimate $\gamma$ in equations (\ref{TWINeqn:realgamma}) and
(\ref{TWINeqn:realgammaN}) is described in section \ref{TWINscn:gamma} of the
paper.  In the case of \citeauthor{Conleyetal2012}'s UCI approach, this estimate
is then sufficient to produce bounds on $\beta_1$, assuming that:
$\gamma\in[0,2\hat\gamma]$. We scale $\hat\gamma$ by the factor of 2 in order for
this value to fall precisely in the middle of the range. \citet{Conleyetal2012}
provide a similar example to calculate the returns to education using the UCI
approach.  In the case of the more precise LTZ approach (our preferred method)
the logic is similar, however now we must form a prior over the entire
distribution of $\gamma$.  Calculating the variance of $\gamma$ is not as
straightforward as using the variance-covariance matrix corresponding to each of
the estimates $\hat\phi^t$ and $\hat\phi^q$.  In this case however we can use
bootstrapping to calculate $J$ replications of $\hat\phi^t\times\hat\phi^q$, and
from these estimates construct an estimated distribution of $\hat\gamma$, which
allows us to determine our prior for the distribution of $\gamma$.  From this
empirical distribution, we observe the estimated mean and standard deviation, and
finally test whether the distribution is normal using a Shapiro Wilk test for
normality. We also use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for equality of distributions to
test whether the distribution is more likely to be log normal, uniform, and a
number of other known analytical distributions. In order to do this, we first
estimate the empirical distribution as described previously.  We then observe the
mean $\hat\mu$ and the standard deviation $\hat\sigma$, and run a one-sample test
to determine whether the observed empirical distribution is is significantly
different to each analytical distribution $\mathcal{N}(\hat\mu,\hat\sigma^2)$,
$U(\hat\mu,\hat\sigma^2)$ or $\ln\mathcal{N}(\hat\mu,\hat\sigma^2)$.

\subsection{Simulation-Based Estimation for non-Normal Distributions}
Estimates of the full distribution of $\gamma$ are presented in Figures
\ref{TWINfig:gammaBootsN} and \ref{TWINfig:gammaBootsL}.  These are
the estimated $\hat\gamma_j$ from $j \in \{1,\ldots,100\}$ bootstrap
replications for $\gamma$ in Nigeria and the United States.  In all cases,
when the underlying empirical distribution is tested for equality against
the overlaid analytical distribution (uniform, normal, log normal, $\chi^2$),
the normal distribution provides the best fit of the analytical with the
empirical distribution.\footnote{In the US, We cannot reject that $\gamma$
  is normal with a p-value of 0.xxxx.  In this case, although we can't reject
  that $\gamma$ is log normal, the p-value is much lower, at 0.xxxx.  Similar
  values for Nigeria suggest xxxx.
}

However, the underlying distribution appears to not be perfectly normal,
and it appears doubtful that this would be the case in distribution.
Fortunately, \citet{Conleyetal2012} describe a simulation-based estimation
method to calculate $\gamma$ in the case of a non-normal distribution for
$\gamma$.  We have followed this methodology using the empirical distribution
calculated bootstrapping for $\gamma$.  This code has been publicly released
as \texttt{plausexog} for Stata \citep{Clarke2014}.  The simulation-based
estimation procedure is described fully in \citet{Conleyetal2012} p.\ 265
as a five step algorithm.  The procedure consists of taking repeated draws
from the variance-covariance matrix estimated using IV with the plausibly
exogenous instrument, and in each case adding to it a draw from the
distribution of $\gamma$, scaled by a quantity which depends
on the strength of the instrument. \citeauthor{Conleyetal2012} refer to the
underlying distibution of $\gamma$ as $F$, and the scale parameter as $A$,
where $A=(X^\prime Z(Z^\prime Z)^{-1}Z^\prime X)^{-1}(X^\prime Z)$.
These repeated draws then lead to a large number of estimates for $\beta$,
the parameter of interest, and a 95\% confidence interval is taken by
forming $[\hat\beta-c_{1-\alpha/2},\hat\beta+c_{\alpha/2}]$, where $c$ are
percentiles of the distribution of simulated estimates.

Thus, as well as estimating the LTZ case where we assume that $\gamma$
is distributed $\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\hat\gamma},\sigma^2_{\hat\gamma})$,
we can estimate a version fully utilizing the bootstrapped distribution
of $\hat\gamma$ described in the previous sub-section.  In this case, we
use as $F$, the distribution of $\gamma$, the empirically estimated
distribution of $\gamma$.  The simulation based algorithm then consists
of taking $b\in 1,\ldots,B$ draws from the empirically estimated $F$, as
well as $B$ draws from the variance-covariance matrix, and defining the
95\% confidence interval based on the 2.5 and 97.5\% quintiles of the
resulting simulated values for $\beta$.
