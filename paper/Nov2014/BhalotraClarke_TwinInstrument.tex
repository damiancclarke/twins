\begin{abstract}
 The incidence of twins has been used to identify the impact of changes in 
 fertility on measures of investment in children born prior to the twins, and
 the emerging consensus in this literature is that there is no evidence of a
 quantity-quality trade-off. We argue that the standard approach is flawed.
 Even if twin conception is random, bringing twins to term is a function of
 maternal health which is difficult to fully observe and which tends to be
 correlated with child quality, rendering the instrument invalid. The neglect
 of this fact in the existing literature will tend to lead to under-estimation of 
 the quantity-quality (Q-Q) trade-off and so could contribute to explaining the 
 negative results in the literature. Our contention that women who produce twin 
 births are positively selected is demonstrated using data from richer and poorer
 countries. Using large samples of microdata from developing countries and from 
 the USA which include indicators of maternal characteristics including health, 
 we show that a significant trade-off emerges upon correcting for these biases. 
 We show that this result is likely to be only a \emph{lower} bound of the true
 Q-Q trade-off and discuss how to estimate the size of these bounds.

\section{Twins}                                    \label{TWINscn:literature}
The ocurrence of twins has fascinated people, not least of all social 
scientists, for as long as recorded history exists. Stories of Romulus and 
Remus, the mythological founders of Rome, date from at least the fourth century 
BC. However, the first use of twins as an exogenous increase in family size in 
the economic literature came much later, in \citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980}.

\citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980} proposed to incorporate twins into an estimation
strategy in order to circumnavigate problems of the joint determination of child 
quantity and quality first raised by \citet{Becker1960,BeckerLewis1973,
BeckerTomes1976}.  Under a number of assumptions, they show that twins as an 
increase to family size will be sufficient to directly identify the interaction
between quality and quantity.  As well as the occurrence of twins pushing at
least some families above their desired total fertility, this requires that 
the twins are random.

Empirically, \citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980} estimate the Q--Q trade-off, 
accounting for the increase in rates of twinning by parity (a biological 
relationship)\footnote{Such a relationship is an empirical regularity in all
data examined. \citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980} report rates which increase by 
parity in USA.  In DHS data a similar pattern is observed, as presented in 
figure \ref{TWINfig:bord}.}, and by total number of births (a mechanical 
relationship).


The occurrence of twin births is a commonly used for identification in economic 
studies. Specifically, twin births as a shock to total fertility have been used 
to motivate the estimation of the quantity-quality trade-off 
(\citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980}, \citet{Blacketal2005}, \citet{Angristetal2010}, 
\citet{Caceres2006}), the effects of childbearing on female labour force 
participation (\citet{RosenzweigWolpin1980b}; \citet{Jacobsenetal1999}, 
\citet{AngristEvans1998}, and the effects of unwed childbearing on marriage 
market outcomes, poverty and welfare receipt (\citet{BronarsGrogger1994}).

%*******************************************************************************
\section{Methodology}                              \label{TWINscn:method}
Empirical analyses of the quality-quantity trade-off focus on producing 
consistent estimates of $\beta_1$ in the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:RF}
educ_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 fert_{j} + \bm{X}\bm{\beta}+u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Here, quality is proxied by the educational attainment of child $i$ in family 
$j$, ($educ$) and fertility ($fert$) is measured as the total births in a child's
family.  A vector of family and child controls is included, denoted $\bm{X}$.  As
has been extensively discussed in prior literature, estimation of $\beta_1$ using
OLS with cross-sectional data will result in biased coefficients given that child 
quality and quantity are jointly determined \citep{BeckerLewis1973,
BeckerTomes1976}, and given that unobservable parental behaviours and attributes 
influence both fertility decisions, and investments in children's education 
\citep{Qian2009}.

\subsection{Quantity-Quality with Twins}           \label{TWINsscn:methodQQ}
One proposed solution has been to employ 2SLS estimation, where fertility is 
is instrumented using twin births.\footnote{Other instruments and methodologies 
are also used including gender mix of children \citep{Angristetal2010}, policy 
experiments \citep{Qian2009}, and historical time series variation in schooling 
\citep{BleakleyLange2009}}  The corresponding first stage is:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:firststage}
fert_{j}=\pi_0+\pi_1 twins_{j}+\bm{X}\bm{\pi}+\nu_{j},
\end{equation}
where $twins_j$ is an indicator for whether the $n^{th}$ birth in a family is a 
twin birth. As described in section \ref{TWINsscn:samples}, the sample in each 
case is the so-called $n+$ group, consisting of children born before birth $n$ 
in families with at least $n$ births.  As such the twins themselves are excluded 
from the estimation sample.\footnote{Typically, the argument is made that twins 
are different to single births, and hence should not be compared in analysis.}
The logic, in quasi-experimental terms, is that existing children (the subjects) 
are randomly assigned either one (control group) or two (treatment group) 
siblings.

Consistent estimation of $\beta_1$ can thus proceed provided (among other
things) that instrumental validity holds:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:IVvalid}
\plim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N twin_ju_{ij}=0
\end{equation}
The typical challenge in IV estimates arises when considering 
(\ref{TWINeqn:IVvalid}); as the error term $u_{ij}$ consists, by nature, of 
unobservable components, whether or not the equality holds cannot be tested 
formally.  There is however nothing which stops us from partially testing 
(\ref{TWINeqn:IVvalid}) by removing a subset of observable components from $u_{ij}$
and testing whether their covariance with $twin_j$ is significantly different
from zero.  The error term $u$ in (\ref{TWINeqn:RF}) is a function of a large 
number of elements:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:IVbias}
\begin{split}
u=f(\text{maternal health stocks, fertility behaviour, positive pregnancy investments,}  \\
\text{parental education, fetal environment,}\ldots)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
While many of the relevant elements are either completely or partially 
unobservable, some of these variables, such as maternal education and partial 
measures of health stocks and behavious, can be observed.  Thus a partial test 
of the twin methodology consists of estimating the following regression.
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twinreg}
twin_{j}=\alpha_0 + \bm{X}\bm{\alpha}_1 + \bm{S}\bm{\alpha}_2
                  + \bm{H}\bm{\alpha}_3 + \varepsilon_{j}.
\end{equation}
Here $\bm{X}$ refers to the initial vector of family and child controls, $\bm{S}$
to additional family socioeconomic variables such as income and parental 
education, and $\bm{H}$ to maternal health variables.  

If twin birth is indeed an event which is as good as random, the coefficients
on maternal health and family socieoeconomic variables in the above regression
should not be significantly different to zero.  We thus test the following 
hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twintest}
H_0: \bm{\alpha}_2 = \bm{\alpha}_3 = 0.
\end{equation}
Rejection of the null would raise difficulties in proceeding with IV estimation 
using the twin instrument. Of course, if the rejection of the null were only due 
to one or a number of \emph{observable} element(s) which predicted twinning, 
these variables could simply be included in the first and second stages above, 
much like occurs with maternal age and race in the existing literature.  However, 
more generally it would be difficult to be argue for instrumental validity if 
twinning is shown to depend upon (a limited set of) measurable family 
characteristic or choice variables, while many similar variables are not observed.

Given the biological demands placed on a mother pregnant with twins, we may 
expect that healthier mothers, or mothers with more resources to invest in their
pregnancy are more likely to take twin conceptions to term.  Similarly, we may
suspect that mothers more able to invest in their children during pregnancy will 
also be more able to invest in their child's human capital after birth.  If this 
is the case, we would see that (at the very least) $\bm{\alpha_2}>0$.  

An alternative test of whether twins appear to be as good as random consists of 
comparing women who give birth to twins with those who give birth to singletons 
\emph{before} these children are born.  If twin births are as good as random, 
the two groups of mothers should appear identical before these births occur.
In order to compare health stocks before twins, we run tests comparing the rate
of infant mortality---a completely predetermined variable---of children in each 
of the $n+$ groups described above.  If, as we contend, healthier mothers are 
more likely to give birth to twins, this should be captured in lower infant 
mortality rates (IMR) in early births.

Assuming additive separability of the elements in the omitted error term, we can 
re-write $u_{ij}$ from (\ref{TWINeqn:firststage}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:IVbias}) as:
\[ u_{ij}=u^S_{ij}+u^H_{ij}+u^*_{ij}. \]
Here $u^S_{ij}$ and $u^H_{ij}$ correspond to the (observable) elements included 
as $\bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ in (\ref{TWINeqn:twinreg}), while $u^*_{ij}$ represents 
the remaining (unobserved) components.  We can thus re-write our IV estimate for 
$\beta_1$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:betabias}
\hat\beta_1^{IV} = \beta_1 + 
\plim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N twin_j(u^S_{ij}+u^H_{ij}+u^*_{ij})
\end{equation}
Typically, this is the coefficient estimated in the existing twin literature 
which assumes that twinning is a conditionally exogenous event.  If, however, the 
likelihood of taking twin conceptions to term increases for healthier and/or 
wealthier mothers, we should include $\bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ in the first and 
second stages, giving
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:betacloser}
\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H} = \beta_1 +
\plim_{N\to \infty} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N twin_ju^*_{ij},
\end{equation}
where the superscript $S+H$ signifies that socioeconomic and health variables 
have been included as additional controls.  What's more, if both the likelihood
that a woman takes twins to term and a family's subsequent investment in child 
human capital are positively correlated with positive health behaviours and other 
positive socioeconomic variables such as parental education, we would expect that:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,H}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.
\]
It should be noted in the above series of inequalities that even conditional upon
socioeconomic and health variables, IV estimation will \emph{not} result in a
consistent estimate of $\beta_1$ if twinning is correlated with unobservable
elements in $u^*_{ij}$.  We return to this point, and how to bound $\beta_1$ in
the following sub-section.

\subsection{Bounding the Q-Q Trade-off}            \label{TWINsscn:methodBounds}
In the previous subsection, Q-Q estimation using twins is motivated in equations 
(\ref{TWINeqn:RF}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:firststage}).  Consistent IV estimation 
imposes the (strong) prior belief that twin births can be excluded from the 
second stage equation, or that the sign of $\gamma$ in the following is equal to 
zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:Conley}
educ_{ij}=\beta_1 fert_j + \gamma twin_j + \bm{X}\bm{\beta} + u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
As we discuss above, this will not be the case if maternal health controls 
omitted from (\ref{TWINeqn:RF}) are correlated with both the likelihood of taking
twin conceptions to term, and with eventual measures of child quality.

However, even in cases such as this where we are not confident that $\gamma=0$,
we can still estimate bounds on the Q-Q tradeoff if we are confident in making
some statement of prior belief about the distribution from which $\gamma$ is 
drawn.  \citet{Conleyetal2012} describe such a process, which they refer to as 
\emph{plausible exogeneity}.  We invoke this terminology here, and refer to 
twins as a plausibly exogenous event, implying that we have reason to believe 
that $\gamma$ may be close to, but not necessarily precisely equal to, zero.
Specifically, we are concerned that healthier mothers are more likely to give
birth to twins, and, all else constant, healthier mothers are more likely to be 
able to invest more in children post-pregnancy.  Thus, $\gamma$, the coefficient 
on twins, reflects the interaction between the partial correlation of a mother's 
health and her likelihood of giving birth to twins, and the partial correlation 
between her health and child quality.

In this paper we estimate $\beta_1$ under a range of assumptions regarding the
true nature of $\gamma$.  Firstly we estimate $\beta_1$ by simply assuming a
support assumption for $\gamma$: namely that $\gamma$ falls between zero (implying 
instrumental validity) and some (positive) number $\delta$:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:uci}
\gamma \in [0,\delta].
\end{equation}
This is a relatively weak assumption, however, as \citet{Conleyetal2012} show,
it allows for us to recover a `union of confidence intervals' (hereafter UCI) 
for estimates of $\beta_1$ over the entire support of $\gamma$.  This UCI, then, 
provides bounds for $\beta_1$ even in the case that twin exogeneity does not 
strictly hold. We also estimate by imposing a stronger prior: specifically we 
fully specify the distribution of $\gamma$ as:
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:ltz}
\gamma \sim U(0,\delta).
\end{equation}
This stronger assumption allows for a tighter estimate of the bounds on 
$\beta_1$.  \citet{Conleyetal2012} provide a full derivation of this result, and 
we follow them in referring to this as a local-to-zero (LTZ) approximation.

Assumptions (\ref{TWINeqn:uci}) and (\ref{TWINeqn:ltz}) depend upon the values
of $\delta$ which we believe hold in the case of twinning and the Q-Q equation.
As such, we estimate both specifications over a wide range of values for 
$\delta$,  
%*******************************************************************************


\section{Results}                                  \label{TWINscn:results}
\subsection{Twinning}                              \label{TWINsscn:twinning}
In table \ref{TWINtab:TwinDHS} we regress a child's twin status (one if a twin, 
zero if a singleton) on their mother's health, education, and a range of other 
demographic and family characteristics.\footnote{In our principal specification, 
the full set of controls are country, child year of birth, and age dummies; a 
cubic function of mother's age at time of birth; mother's age at time of first 
birth; mother's education and education squared; and mother's height and BMI. 
We cluster standard errors at the level of the mother.}  These results suggest
that twin births are not random, even after conditioning on maternal age and 
child birth order as is typical in the recent twin literature summarised in table
\ref{TWINtab:Lit}. The inclusion of a full set of country and year-of-birth
dummies (not displayed in table \ref{TWINtab:TwinDHS}) will capture any 
systematic trend in the frequency of twin births across time or regions, and 
country dummies will absorb all time invariant differences in the probability 
of a twin birth across countries. The estimated coefficients and signs support 
the idea discussed in section 4 that higher investments (for example in maternal 
health) required to maintain multiple healthy fetuses in utero may result in 
non-random twin births. We return to the mechanism by which twin selection may
occur in the following section.

Initially, results from the pooled DHS data are presented as this provides a 
particularly large sample with which to test the hypothesis of twin exogeneity. 
This is presented in table \ref{TWINtab:TwinDHS} column (1) and provides 
considerable evidence that live twin births are related to family choice 
variables such as education (tests for the joint significance of socioeconomic 
variables and health variables are rejected with p-values of $<$0.00).  
Regressions displayed here are estimated by OLS, however are robust to 
alternative functional forms and estimation methods.\footnote{Significant and 
quantitatively similar results are found if a logit model is estimated rather 
than a linear probability model, and when running separate models for twinning at 
each birth order. Similarly, if we run the regression at the level of the mother 
or include any combination of fertility measures, similar patterns are observed.
Alternatively, rather than running a regression we can run (unconditional) balance 
of characteristics tests by twin status.  These are available in the online 
appendix (table \ref{TWINtab:Balance}).  The findings are similar.}

Columns (2)--(5) suggest that these results, especially when considering 
maternal health, are not the result of only the most low income countries, or
only the post-IVF time period.  Given that the frequency of multiple births 
increases in cases where the mother undergoes fertility treatment, column (5) 
presents regression results for births in a period not potentially 
affected by IVF.\footnote{In order to be conservative, we estimate for the period 
preceeding 1990, the date which coincides with the first reported successful 
use of IVF in South Africa, an early-adopter among DHS countries.}  Pre- and 
post-1990 results are qualitatively similar although education is no longer 
significant prior to 1990 (in the smaller sample). Mother's height and BMI:
measures of health stocks, are positively correlated with twinning regardless
of the sample.  Similarly, this result is not driven by a particular country
or region.  Figure \ref{TWINfig:arrows} provides evidence that healthy women (as 
proxied by height) are significantly more likely to have twins in nearly all of 
the 68 countries included in DHS surveys.  Along with higher average rates of 
twinning in countries with taller women, a positive within-country gradient 
exists, with taller women in a given country more likely to have twins than their 
shorter counterparts. The size of DHS estimates are considerable. Increasing a
woman's height by 1 standard deviation increases the probability of twinning by 
0.44\% (as compared to a mean rate of twins of 1.85\%).

Results for the infant mortality test described in the previous section are
presented in table \ref{TWINtab:IMR}.  In row 1, we regress IMR for first-borns
on the twin status of second-borns.\footnote{IMR is defined as 1 for children
who die before their first birthday.  We remove from the sample any children who
were not yet 1 at the time of the following birth, as these children have not
yet been entirely exposed to the risk of infant mortality.}  Mothers who have 
second-born twins have much lower rates of infant mortality \emph{before} the 
twins than women who had second-born singletons.  This suggests that mothers of 
twins are healthier when considering pre-determined measures of health.  
Similarly, the rates of infant mortality among first- and second-borns are much 
lower in families of women who have third-born twins than in those who have 
third-born singletons.  This holds for all parity levels examined.

Much of the existing twin literature focuses on the USA, or other developed
countries. In table \ref{TWINtab:TwinNHIS}, we provide similar regressions for 
women in the USA based on the full set of NHIS surveys.  These results show
that twins are not as good as random, even in the context of a country with 
a more developed healthcare system and social safety nets. Taller mothers,
heavier mothers, and mothers who don't smoke prior to conception (a positive
health behaviour) are significantly more likely to have twins.

The dependence of twinning on positive maternal health stocks and behaviours is
a consistent and quantitatively important phenomenon in all data sets we have
examined.  We have compiled data and run similar regressions using vital 
statistics data from the USA, Brazil, Spain, Scotland and Sweden, and 
additional survey data from Chile and the United Kingdom (see tables 
\ref{TWINtab:TwinNVSS}--\ref{TWINtab:SwedenTwin} for results).  In each case,
the probability of twinning increases as mothers become more healthy and are
less likely to engage in risky health behaviours before and during pregnancy.
Along with the results described in tables \ref{TWINtab:TwinDHS} and 
\ref{TWINtab:TwinNHIS}, these additional sources of data show that mothers
who consume alcohol, tobacco or other drugs, who suffer from chronic disease 
or who have less access to prenatal care are significantly less likely to twin.

Finally, if twinning is related to positive health stocks and behaviours of
prospective mothers and families, we can examine how rates of twinning respond
to time-series variations in (female) health outcomes.  While only suggestive,
as many other environmental variables may explain changes in twinning, 
time-series evidence from the USA leads to similar conclusions.  Figure
\ref{TWINfig:USTwin} plots the rate of twinning from vital statistics data since
birth type (single or multiple) was first recorded.  Interestingly, the rate of
twins has increased steadily over time, even before the advent of IVF and other
fertilisation treatments.  This is in line with increasing trends in female
health over this period, which is proxied by female life expectancy and plotted
in the same figure.


%*******************************************************************************
\subsection{Selection into twinning: mechanisms}   \label{TWINsscn:selection}
In a wide variety of contexts, healthier women are more likely to give birth to
twins.  There are a number of competing hypotheses which may explain why this is
the case.  Firstly, it may simply be the case that healthier mothers are more 
likely to conceive twins.  This may reflect some underlying biological process, 
such as that mediated by follicle stimulating hormone as discussed in 
\citet{Hall2003}.  Secondly, conditional on conceiving twins, healthier mothers 
may be more likely to take both fetuses to term.  Finally, it may be the case 
that (conditional on conceiving twins and taking them to term), healthier mothers 
may be more likely to survive the birth, and hence appear in survey or vital 
statistics data.  In broad terms we will refer to these as the conception 
mechanism, the gestation mechanism and the birth (survival) mechanism.

When considering IV estimates with twins, any of these processes is sufficient 
to invalidate causal inference insofar as observing twins depends upon hard 
to measure maternal behaviours and characteristics.  Nonetheless, we may be 
interested in determing which of these are the relevant channels in explaining 
the results from the previous section.  Particularly, the mechanism may be 
relevant when considering the use of the instrument.  For example, if twins are 
less likely \emph{only} due to selective maternal death, then as mothers become 
more likely to survive childbirth (ie moving from high maternal mortality 
countries to low maternal mortality countries), threats to instrumental validity 
become less relevant.

We test these mechanisms below.  In order to determine whether twin selection
could be entirely explained by selective maternal survival, we follow 
\citet{Aldermanetal2011} in simulating estimates under the counterfactual 
scenario that unhealthy women---who are more likely to die in childbirth---%
were all carrying twins. Using DHS data described in section 
\ref{TWINsscn:data}, we observe a woman's height, BMI, pregnancy outcomes, and 
the maternal mortality status of all her sisters.  As we do not observe health 
stocks of women who died in childbirth, we assume that her sister's health 
(height and BMI) is a reasonable proxy for the health of the woman who died 
within 42 days of giving birth (which is classed as a maternal death).  Appendix 
figure \ref{TWINfig:survival} shows that maternal mortality is much higher among 
more unhealthy women.  Women shorter than the mean height of 155.5 cm are 
considerably more likely to suffer maternal death, with this being particularly 
so below heights of 145cm.

To test the potential importance of maternal survival in explaining twin 
selection, we simulate observations for the number of women who, according to 
DHS data, would exist in the sample if it were not for the fact that they died 
in childbirth.  We then examine the coefficients of interest in our twin 
regression (\ref{TWINeqn:twinreg}), if all unhealthy women who died were 
pregnant with twins, while all healthy women who died were not.  As this relies 
on a binary `healthy vs unhealthy' distinction, we define this in various ways, 
based on height and BMI.  These results are presented in table 
\ref{TWINtab:Alderman}.  The first column shows the estimated coefficients on 
height and BMI in the unaltered sample of women from DHS countries where 
maternal mortality data is available.  In this sample, a BMI increase of 1 
point is associated with a 0.046\% increase in the probability of twinning. The 
remaining columns add in observations based on maternal mortality rates among 
sisters of surveyed women.  For example, in the second column, we examine the 
effect of adding to the sample unhealthy and healthy women based on the maternal 
mortality rate in each group, and then assuming that all unhealthy women would 
give birth to twins, and all healthy mothers would not. As expected, this 
reduces the importance of positive maternal health in predicting twinning, with 
the coefficient on BMI falling from 0.0460 to 0.0437. The other columns continue 
in this manner, however using continually less conservative assumptions in 
assigning members to the unhealthy group who are defined as giving birth to 
twins. Even in the final column, where the entire bottom half of the 
anthropometric distribution is assumed as being unhealthy, the coefficient on 
both height and BMI remains positive and significant.\footnote{Examining 
selection in this way (as per \citet{Aldermanetal2011}) is only one way to 
examine the effect of selection on estimated coefficients.  An alternative 
measure as proposed by \citet{Lee2009} involves trimming the control and 
treatment group (in our case unhealthy and healthy mothers), to account for 
differential selection by treatment status.  This results in bounds estimates 
of the effect of treatment (good health) on the outcome variable (twinning). We 
report Lee bounds in appendix table \ref{TWINtab:Lee}, however note that these 
bounds are based on the assumption that treatment is random, which here it is 
not.  Nonetheless, \citet{Lee2009} bounds agree with the simulated estimates in 
table \ref{TWINtab:Alderman}, providing further evidence that selective maternal 
survival is not enough to explain the correlation between maternal health and 
twinning.}

These results suggest that selective maternal death is not enough to explain
why healthier mothers are more likely to have twins. Turning to the gestation 
mechanism, we are able to test whether less healthy women who are pregnant with 
twins are more likely to miscarry than healthier women who are also pregnant 
with twins.  In one DHS survey (Nepal), data on miscarriages as well as the 
type of miscarriage (single or multiple fetuses), is recorded.  We thus run a 
series of regressions where miscarriage is the dependent variable, and the 
independent variables are a measures of poor maternal health, whether the 
pregnancy is single or multiple, and interactions between pregnancy type and 
poor maternal health.  We would expect that both poor maternal health and a 
non-singleton pregnancy increase the likelihood of miscarriage, however we are 
interested in determing if more unhealthy mothers are \emph{more} likely to 
miscarry twins than healthy mothers carrying twins.  Thus, we are interested in 
testing if the coefficients on the interaction terms are significantly larger 
than zero.

These regression results are reported in table \ref{TWINtab:Miscarry}.  As 
expected, columns (1) and (2) suggest that more unhealthy and less educated
women are more likely to report ever miscarrying.\footnote{These results hold 
conditional and unconditional on total fertility.}  Maternal health stocks are 
proxied by height and BMI, where (negative) outcomes for these variables such as 
underweight and very underweight are based on ICD-10 definitions. Turning to the 
interaction terms, although standard errors are reasonably large due to the low 
frequency of twinning, women who are unhealthy (as proxied by a very low BMI), 
and with no education are significantly more likely to miscarry with twins.  
Using a richer set of variables from administrative data in the USA and Spain, 
similar regressions are run.  The results in appendix tables 
\ref{TWINtab:USAMiscarry} and \ref{TWINtab:SpainMiscarry} suggest that, 
depending on the context, less educated women and women who report consuming 
alcohol during pregnancy are more likely to miscarry twins than mothers with 
higher education and who do not consume alcohol.

\subsection{The twin instrument and the Q-Q trade-off} \label{TWINsscn:QQtwins}
Results from section \ref{TWINsscn:twinning} show that twinning is not as good
as random, even when conditioning on race, maternal age, and even parental 
education. Healthier mothers are more likely to have twins. If these mothers 
also invest more after birth, the Q-Q trade-off will be under-estimated (we can 
see this by considering the term $twin_ju^H_{ij}$ in equation 
(\ref{TWINeqn:betabias}).  However, progressively including additional health
controls in our first and second stage equations should drive IV estimates in 
the direction of the true Q-Q trade-off from below.

Conversely, OLS estimates are typically thought to over-estimate the true 
magnitude of the Q-Q trade-off.  If unobserved parental behaviours favour both
lower fertility and higher child human capital,\footnote{As a (highly stylised) 
example, consider a prospective mother's eventual labour market plans. A mother 
who plans to join the labour market may prefer fewer children, facilitating more 
immediate labour force participation, but have more resources to invest in child
quality.} OLS estimates of $\beta_1$ will be negatively biased, and hence 
\emph{more} negative than the true trade-off.  As items are removed from the
error term and included in the principal equation to be estimated by OLS, we thus 
expect that these estimates should approach the true parameter from above.

We examine this intuition by estimating $\beta_1$ from (\ref{TWINeqn:RF}) by OLS 
and IV. Our principal data is the large DHS sample, where quality is measured by
school Z-score, a child's educational attainment compared to his or her country
birth cohort.  After considering DHS estimates we turn to NHIS data from USA.

Table \ref{TWINtab:OLS} reports pooled OLS estimates from all DHS data, and in 
low and middle-income country groups. OLS is estimated separately by the 2+, 3+,
and 4+ fertility groups, and included in appendix table \ref{TWINtab:OLSplus}.

\subsection{Bounding the Q-Q trade-off}            \label{TWINsscn:resultBounds}
The results from the previous subsection provide consistent estimates of 
$\beta_1$ via 2SLS \emph{if} the full set of controls completely account for 
those characteristics and behaviours which predict giving live birth to twins. 
However, given that we have shown that twinning is predicted by a wide range of 
health behaviours, and given that maternal health variables in these datasets 
do not exhaustively capture all aspects of health stocks and behaviours, it seems 
unlikely that all relevant variables are included in these specifications. As 
such, we turn to \citeauthor{Conleyetal2012}'s \citeyear{Conleyetal2012} 
methodology to estimate bounds for the Q-Q trade-off.  

As outlined in section \ref{TWINsscn:methodBounds}, this involves the definition 
of some prior belief over the sign and magnitude that the coefficient on twinning 
would take in the structural equation \ref{TWINeqn:Conley}. Results are displayed 
in figures \ref{TWINfig:ltz2} and \ref{TWINfig:ltz3}, and in table 
\ref{TWINtab:Conley}. At each point on the horizontal axis of figures 
\ref{TWINfig:ltz2} and \ref{TWINfig:ltz3}, the bounds for $\beta_1$ are 
displayed, along with the corresponding point estimate under the assumption that 
$\gamma$ is distributed $\sim U(0,\delta)$. Dashed lines present the 95% 
confidence interval, while the solid line represents the point estimate.


\section{Conclusion}                               \label{TWINscn:conclusion}
Twin births are not random.  Indeed, they appear to be far from it, in a wide
variety of environments, time periods and contexts.  Based on a considerable 
body of evidence compiled from vital statistics and survey data from low- and 
high-income countries, we demonstrate that mothers with greater health stocks 
and those who engage in positive health-related behaviours are much more likely 
to take twins to term.
