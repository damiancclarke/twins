\begin{abstract}
 The incidence of twins has been used to identify the impact of changes in 
 fertility on measures of investment in children born prior to the twins, and
 the emerging consensus in this literature is that there is no evidence of a
 quantity-quality trade-off. We argue that the standard approach is flawed.
 Even if twin conception is random, bringing twins to term is a function of
 maternal health which is difficult to fully observe and which tends to be
 correlated with child quality, rendering the instrument invalid. The neglect
 of this fact in the existing literature will tend to lead to
 under-estimation of the quality-quantity (Q-Q) trade-off and so could
 contribute to explaining the negative results in the literature. Our contention
 that women who produce twin births are positively selected is demonstrated using
 data from richer and poorer countries. Using a large sample of microdata from
 developing countries which include indicators of maternal characteristics
 including health, we show that a significant trade-off emerges upon correcting
 for these biases. We show that this result is likely to be only a \emph{lower}
 bound of the true Q-Q trade-off and discuss how to estimate the size of these
 bounds.

\subsection{Selection into twinning: mechanisms}   \label{TWINsscn:selection}
In a wide variety of contexts, healthier women are more likely to give birth to
twins.  There are a number of competing hypotheses which may explain why this is
the case.  Firstly, it may simply be the case that healthier mothers are more 
likely to conceive twins.  This may reflect some underlying biological process, 
such as that mediated by follicle stimulating hormone as discussed in 
\citet{Hall2003}.  Secondly, conditional on conceiving twins, healthier mothers 
may be more likely to take both fetuses to term.  Finally, it may be the case 
that (conditional on conceiving twins and taking them to term), healthier mothers 
may be more likely to survive the birth, and hence appear in surveys or vital 
statistics data.  In broad terms we will refer to these as the conception 
mechanism, the gestation mechanism and the birth survival mechanism.

When considering instrumental estimates, any of these processes is sufficient to
invalidate causal inference insofar as observing twins now depends upon hard to
measure maternal behaviours and characteristics..  Nonetheless, we may be 
interested in determing which of these are the relevant channels to explain the
results from the previous section.  Particularly, the mechanism may be relevant
when considering the use of the instrument.  For example, if twins are less 
likely \emph{only} due to selective maternal death, then as mothers are more 
likely to survive childbirth (ie moving from high maternal mortality countries 
to low maternal mortality countries), threats to instrumental validity become 
less relevant.

We test these mechanisms below.  While credible data on twin conceptions is hard 
to come by, we are able to test each of the other two mechanisms.  Firstly, when
considering the gestation mechanism, we are able to test whether less healthy
mothers are more likely to miscarry twins.  While data on miscarriages as well
as the type of miscarriage (single or multiple fetuses), are somewhat hard to 
come by, in one DHS survey (Nepal) this is recorded.  We thus run a series of 
regressions where miscarriage is the dependent variable, and the independent
variables are a measures of poor maternal health, whether the pregnancy is 
single or multiple, and interactions between pregnancy type and poor maternal 
health.  We would expect that both poor maternal health and a non-singleton
pregnancy increase the likelihood of miscarriage, however we are interested in
determing if more unhealthy mothers are \emph{more} likely to miscarry twins
than healthy mothers carrying twins.  Thus, we are interested in testing if the
coefficients on the interaction terms are significantly larger than zero.

These regression results are reported in table \ref{TWINtab:Miscarry}.  As 
expected, columns (1) and (2) suggest that more unhealthy and less educated
women are more likely to report ever miscarrying.\footnote{These results hold 
conditional and unconditional on total fertility.}  Maternal health stocks 
are proxied by height and BMI, where (negative) outcomes for these variables
such as underweight are based on ICD definitions.  Turning to the interaction
terms, although standard errors are reasonably large due to the low frequency
of twinning, women who are unhealthy (as proxied by a very low BMI), and with
no education are significantly more likely to miscarry with twins.  Using a
richer set of variables from administrative data in the USA and Spain, similar 
regressions are run.  The results in appendix tables \ref{TWINtab:USAMiscarry}
and \ref{TWINtab:SpainMiscarry} suggest that, depending on the context, less
educated women and women who report consuming alcohol during pregnancy are
more likely to miscarry twins than mothers with higher education and who do
not consume alcohol.
