\begin{abstract}
 The incidence of twins has been used to identify the impact of changes in 
 fertility on measures of investment in children born prior to the twins, and
 the emerging consensus in this literature is that there is no evidence of a
 quantity-quality trade-off. We argue that the standard approach is flawed.
 Even if twin conception is random, bringing twins to term is a function of
 maternal health which is difficult to fully observe and which tends to be
 correlated with child quality, rendering the instrument invalid. The neglect
 of this fact in the existing literature will tend to lead to under-estimation of 
the quality-quantity (Q-Q) trade-off and so could contribute to explaining the 
negative results in the literature. Our contention that women who produce twin 
births are positively selected is demonstrated using data from richer and poorer
 countries. Using a large sample of microdata from developing countries which
 include indicators of maternal characteristics including health, we show that a
 significant trade-off emerges upon correcting for these biases. We show that
 this result is likely to be only a \emph{lower} bound of the true Q-Q
 trade-off and discuss how to estimate the size of these bounds.

\subsection{Selection into twinning: mechanisms}   \label{TWINsscn:selection}
In a wide variety of contexts, healthier women are more likely to give birth to
twins.  There are a number of competing hypotheses which may explain why this is
the case.  Firstly, it may simply be the case that healthier mothers are more 
likely to conceive twins.  This may reflect some underlying biological process, 
such as that mediated by follicle stimulating hormone as discussed in 
\citet{Hall2003}.  Secondly, conditional on conceiving twins, healthier mothers 
may be more likely to take both fetuses to term.  Finally, it may be the case 
that (conditional on conceiving twins and taking them to term), healthier mothers 
may be more likely to survive the birth, and hence appear in survey or vital 
statistics data.  In broad terms we will refer to these as the conception 
mechanism, the gestation mechanism and the birth (survival) mechanism.

When considering IV estimates with twins, any of these processes is sufficient 
to invalidate causal inference insofar as observing twins depends upon hard 
to measure maternal behaviours and characteristics.  Nonetheless, we may be 
interested in determing which of these are the relevant channels in explaining 
the results from the previous section.  Particularly, the mechanism may be 
relevant when considering the use of the instrument.  For example, if twins are 
less likely \emph{only} due to selective maternal death, then as mothers become 
more likely to survive childbirth (ie moving from high maternal mortality 
countries to low maternal mortality countries), threats to instrumental validity 
become less relevant.

We test these mechanisms below.  In order to determine whether twin selection
could be entirely explained by selective maternal survival, we follow 
\citet{Aldermanetal2011} in simulating estimates under the counterfactual 
scenario that unhealthy women---who are more likely to die in childbirth---%
were all carrying twins.  Using DHS data described in section \ref{TWINsscn:data},
we observe a woman's height, BMI, pregnancy outcomes, and the maternal mortality
status of all her sisters.  As we do not observe health stocks of women who died
in childbirth, we assume that her sister's health (height and BMI) is a reasonable 
proxy for the health of the woman who died within 42 days of giving birth (a 
maternal death).  Appendix figure \ref{TWINfig:survival} shows that maternal 
mortality is much higher among more unhealthy women.  Women shorter than the mean 
height of 155.5 cm are considerably more likely to suffer maternal death, with this 
being particularly so below heights of 145cm.

To test the potential importance of maternal survival in explaining twin selection, 
we simulate observations for the number of women who, according to DHS data would 
exist in the sample if it were not for the fact that they died in childbirth.  We 
then examine the coefficients of interest in our twin regression (REFERENCE), if
all unhealthy women who died were pregnant with twins, while all healthy women
who died were not.  As this relies on a binary `healthy vs unhealthy' 
distinction, we define this in various ways, based on height and BMI.  These
results are presented in table \ref{TWINtab:Alderman}.  The first column shows
the estimated coefficients on height and BMI in the unaltered sample of women
from DHS countries where maternal mortality data is available.  In this sample,
a BMI increase of 1 point is associated with a 0.046\% increase in the 
probability of twinning.  The remaining columns add in observations based on
maternal mortality rates among sisters of surveyed women.  For example, in the
second column, we examine the effect of adding to the sample unhealthy and
healthy women based on the maternal mortality rate in each group, and then
assuming that all unhealthy women would give birth to twins, and all healthy
mothers would not.  As expected, this reduces the importance of positive 
maternal health in predicting twinning, with the coefficient on BMI falling from
0.0460 to 0.0437.  The other columns continue in this manner, however using
continually less conservative assumptions in assigning members to the unhealthy 
group who are defined as giving birth to twins.  Even in the final column, where 
the entire bottom half of the anthropometric distribution is assumed as being 
unhealthy, the coefficient on both height and BMI remains positive and 
significant.\footnote{Examining selection in this way (as per 
\citet{Aldermanetal2011}) is only one way to examine the effect of selection on 
estimated coefficients.  An alternative measure as proposed by \citet{Lee2009} 
involves trimming the control and treatment group (in our case unhealthy and 
healthy mothers), to account for differential selection by treatment status.  
This results in bounds estimates of the effect of treatment (good health) on 
the outcome variable (twinning).  We report Lee bounds in appendix table 
\ref{TWINtab:Lee}, however note that these bounds are based on the assumption 
that treatment is random, which here it is not.  Nonetheless, \citet{Lee2009} 
bounds agree with the simulated estimates in table \ref{TWINtab:Alderman}, 
providing further evidence that selective maternal survival is not enough to 
explain the correlation between maternal health and twinning.}


These results suggest that selective maternal death is not enough to explain
why healthier mothers are more likely to have twins. Turning to the gestation 
mechanism, we are able to test whether less healthy women who are pregnant with 
twins are more likely to miscarry than healthier women who are also pregnant 
with twins.  In one DHS survey (Nepal), data on miscarriages as well as the 
type of miscarriage (single or multiple fetuses), is recorded.  We thus run a 
series of regressions where miscarriage is the dependent variable, and the 
independent variables are a measures of poor maternal health, whether the 
pregnancy is single or multiple, and interactions between pregnancy type and 
poor maternal health.  We would expect that both poor maternal health and a 
non-singleton pregnancy increase the likelihood of miscarriage, however we are 
interested in determing if more unhealthy mothers are \emph{more} likely to 
miscarry twins than healthy mothers carrying twins.  Thus, we are interested in 
testing if the coefficients on the interaction terms are significantly larger 
than zero.

These regression results are reported in table \ref{TWINtab:Miscarry}.  As 
expected, columns (1) and (2) suggest that more unhealthy and less educated
women are more likely to report ever miscarrying.\footnote{These results hold 
conditional and unconditional on total fertility.}  Maternal health stocks 
are proxied by height and BMI, where (negative) outcomes for these variables
such as underweight and very underweight are based on ICD-10 definitions.  
Turning to the interaction terms, although standard errors are reasonably large 
due to the low frequency of twinning, women who are unhealthy (as proxied by a 
very low BMI), and with no education are significantly more likely to miscarry 
with twins.  Using a richer set of variables from administrative data in the USA 
and Spain, similar regressions are run.  The results in appendix tables 
\ref{TWINtab:USAMiscarry} and \ref{TWINtab:SpainMiscarry} suggest that, 
depending on the context, less educated women and women who report consuming 
alcohol during pregnancy are more likely to miscarry twins than mothers with 
higher education and who do not consume alcohol.
