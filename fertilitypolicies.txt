1.1.4 Population Policy 
Out of concern for improving the country’s quality of life, the Rwandan government has developed 
strategies to ensure an acceptable balance between demographic growth and available resources, particularly since 
the 1980s. 
A family planning initiative developed in 1982 provided for training, improved access to family planning 
services and, in particular, the promotion of family planning through trained communicators known as 
Abakangurambaga (“Awakeners of the People”). A subsequent policy was adopted in 1990 aimed at curbing 
demographic growth and reducing fertility through family planning. To create an environment favorable to 
behavioral change that would result in lower fertility rates, other elements were included in the plan, such as 

increased production, public health improvements, land use planning, training of communicators, the promotion of 
education and school attendance, and the employment and advancement of women. 
Following the 1994 genocide, population problems were seen in a new light, with emphasis on both quality 
of life and population growth. A new national population  policy was developed and issued to all development 
partners in 2003. This policy emphasizes quality of life by providing objectives and strategies to affect both 
demographic (fertility, mortality) and socioeconomic factors. The policy advocates slow population growth, 
managed sustainability of natural resources, food safety, access to primary and secondary education for all children 
(with a focus on technical and vocational instruction as well as information technology), good governance, equal 
opportunity, and participation in development by both men and women.
