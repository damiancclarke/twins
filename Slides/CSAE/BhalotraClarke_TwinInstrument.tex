\section{Introduction}
\frame{\frametitle{This Talk}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Twin births \emph{are not} exogenous: even if twin conceptions are exogenous, taking twins to term depends on health stocks and behaviours of mothers during pregnancy
\item We present the first evidence that this is a widespread phenomenon in rich and poor countries
\item This results in violation of the exclusion restriction and hence inconsistent estimates in studies that use twins to instrument fertility in studies of the Q-Q trade-off
\item The bias is positive (in contrast to the OLS bias which is negative). We show that bias-correction approaches produce stronger evidence of a trade-off
\item  Previous ignorance of this bias contributes to explaining the tendency for recent studies to reject the presence of a Q-Q tradeoff (Angrist et al.\ 2010, Black et al.\ 2005)

\frame{\frametitle{The Quantity--Quality Trade-off}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ample evidence from \hyperlink{Macro}{\textcolor{blue}{cross-sectional data}} within and across regions suggests that children from larger families have weaker educational outcomes, e.g. Hanushek 1992, Blake 1989.
 \item This empirical regularity is often attributed to a quantity-quality (QQ) trade-off in parental investments: Becker 1960, Becker and Lewis 1973, Becker and Tomes 1976.
 \item Child quality and child quantity enter multiplicatively in the budget constraint. It follows that (Galor 2012):
\begin{itemize}
 \item Exogenous reductions in the price of quality raise the shadow price of having more children.
 \item Exogenous reductions in the price of quantity (of children) reduce the marginal cost of investing in quality
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\frame{

\Large \textcolor{blue}{Methodology}
\end{center}

}


\subsection{Motivation}
\frame{\frametitle{IV Procedure}
OLS fails to recover consistent estimates of the QQ trade-off (endogeneity, multiplicative entry of QQ).  Often, use IV:
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:secondstage}
educ_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 fert_{j} + \bm{X}\bm{\beta}_2+u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:firststage}
fert_{j}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 twins_{j}+\bm{X}\bm{\alpha}_2+\nu_{j},
\end{equation}
\vspace{2mm}
And so assuming:
\[
E[fert_j\cdot u_{ij}] \neq 0, \ E[twins_j\cdot u_{ij}] = 0
\]
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Previous studies assume twin incidence is a valid instrument.
\item A key concern is whether IV estimates are precise enough to be informative (and distinguishable from OLS estimates): Angrist et al.\ 2010.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Investigating Exogeneity of Twins (I)}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twinreg}
P(twin_{j})=\gamma_0 + \bm{X}\bm{\gamma}_1 + \bm{S}\bm{\gamma}_2
                  + \bm{H}\bm{\gamma}_3 + \varepsilon_{j}.
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bm{X}, \bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ are mother characteristics potentially correlated with child quality: age, wealth, education, height, BMI during pregnancy, antenatal care availability, smoking/drinking/drugs during pregnancy.
\item If twin birth is a random event $\bm{\gamma_1}=\bm{\gamma_2}=\bm{\gamma_3}=0$
\item Can typically condition on only a subset of predictors $X$
\item Equivalent: test of balance of characteristics between mothers who have twins (quasi-treatment) and mothers who do not (quasi-control)
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Investigating Exogeneity of Twins (II)}
Examine whether women who have twins are healthier before twins or twins occurr:
\vspace{2mm}
\[Quality_{t-k}=\alpha twins_{t}+\bm{X}\delta + \varepsilon \]
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare child quality in families with and without twins at parity $p$ for children born at earlier parities. 
\item But use a measure of quality (investment) that is necessarily determined before twins occur: infant mortality.
\item If twins occur randomly, $\alpha=0$.  If positively selected, $\alpha<0$.
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{\frametitle{Twin Endogeneity and IV Inconsistency}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Refurbish $\bm{X}$.  Ours is the first attempt to condition on (partial indicators) of mother's health
\item Estimate bounds on QQ-parameter when twin instrument is almost but not exactly exogenous.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{5mm}
Thereby assess possibility that there is a QQ trade-off, obscured in recent studies by bias associated with assuming twin exogeneity.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Twin Endogeneity and IV Inconsistency}
Assuming additive separability of $u_{ij}$: $u_{ij}=u_{ij}^S+u_{ij}^H+u_{ij}^*$.  The typical IV estimate is 
then the population value, plus (unobserved) error components:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV} = \beta_1 + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^S_{ij} + 
P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^H_{ij} + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^*_{ij}
\]

\vspace{6mm}
We can remove certain observed variables from the error term.  By including elements $S$ and $H$ as additional controls in $\bm{X}$, the IV estimate becomes:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H} = \beta_1 + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^*_{ij},
\]
\vspace{3mm}
where it is likely that $\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,H}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.$
}

\frame{\frametitle{Twin Endogeneity and IV Inconsistency}
\begin{center}
\[\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,H}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.\]
\end{center}
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{spacing}{1.2}
Maternal health and pregnancy behaviours are multidimensional and partially unobserved.  In order
to put limits on the inconsistency $\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1$, we use a number of partial
identification and bounds techniques
\end{spacing}
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bound between (upward biased) OLS and (downward biased) IV
\item Combine OLS with Altonji-Taber, and Olsen bounds
\item Combine IV with Conley et al bounds (similar to Rosen and Nevo)

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparable cross-country micro-data for developing countries from the Demographic and Health Surveys
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete fertility histories, subjective reports of desired fertility, indicators of maternal health, maternal education and child education.
\end{itemize}
\item Merge all surveys between 1991 and 2013: sample of 2,721,619 children from 68 countries
\begin{itemize}
\item Large sample useful given twin are rare (sample mean 1.89\%)
\item Outcome: schooling (z-score). Retain children age 6-17 at survey date.
\item Birth cohorts 1971-2012 (include country and birth cohort FE)
\end{itemize}
\item Countries classified as low vs middle income by the World Bank
\begin{itemize}
\item Women in poor countries under-nourished and less able to take twin conceptions to term. Higher desired fertility, twins are less likely than otherwise to take actual over desired fertility. Low schooling.

\item Effects of twins at parity $j$ on outcomes for births $j-1$ and before (as in Black et al. 2005). 
\begin{itemize}
\item Predictions are for infra-marginal children.
\end{itemize}
\item Nomenclature: ``2+ sample'' Firstborn subjects in families with at least two births (allowing that a birth may be twin). 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instrument with twins at second birth
\end{itemize}
\item ``3+ sample'': First and second born subjects in families with at least three births 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instrument with twins at third birth
\end{itemize}
\item And simiarly for 4+.  Twin subjects are generally dropped.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Data and Context}
\begin{itemize}
\item By restricting to families with at least $j$ births on average we ensure that preferences over family size are the same in the families with twins at the $j^{th}$ birth and those with singleton births
\item By restricting the sample to children born before birth $j$, we avoid selection problems that arise because families who choose to have another child after a twin birth may differ from families who choose to have another child after a singleton birth.

\item These surveys have rich microdata on maternal and child health and education, 
and full fertility histories
\item This provides $\sim$250,000 births which let us run full IV and OLS specifications
in a developed country setting

\item But, recognised that maternal health and behaviours affects a large number of other birth and longer term outcomes (Mazumder and Seeskin, 2014; Black et al.\ 2014;  Bhalotra and Rawlings 2013; Almond et al.\ 2011; Barker 1995).
\item And evidence from medical literature (Li et al.\ 2003, Hall 2003) that Pr(twinning) increases with age, weight and height (mediated by follicle stimulating hormone) 
\item We compile many datasets and measures of mother health stocks and behaviours preceding births

\item A one s.d. change in the height of the mother results in an increase of 0.44\% points (22\% of mean)
\item A one s.d. change in mother’s BMI results in an increase of 0.20\% points (10\% of mean)
\item \hyperlink{Balance}{\textcolor{blue}{Tests of balance}} by `quasi-treatment vs.\ quasi-control' lead to the similar conclusions

\item We have compiled evidence using a number of surveys and administrative data sets:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \hyperlink{Chile}{\textcolor{blue}{Chile}}
  \item \hyperlink{UK}{\textcolor{blue}{UK}}
  \item \hyperlink{USA1}{\textcolor{blue}{USA}} (National Vital Statistics System)

\subsection{OLS Estimates}
\frame{\frametitle{OLS Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS estimates will over-estimate the size of the trade-off if fertility and investments in children are simultaneously determined
\item Similarly, parental heterogeneity by fertility level will bias estimates (Qian, 2005)
\item Can use the Altonji-Taber statistic to assess the chance that the estimated trade-off is entirely spurrious
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{OLS Estimates}
Adding controls for predictors of twin birth diminishes the estimated trade-off

}

\frame{\frametitle{Altonji, Elder, Taber 2005, extension in Bellows and Miguel 2009}
\[
educ = \beta fert + X\delta + e
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Fertility is endogenous and instrumented by twins and $X$ is a vector of relevant controls, conditional upon which twins are a valid instrument.
\item Suppose we observe only a random sub-set of $X$.
\item Assume that the observed and unobserved components of X are correlated and selection on unobservables is similar to selection on observables.
\item Compute the ratio of $\hat\beta_c/(\hat\beta_n-\hat\beta_c)$. A large ratio (given by controls not changing $\hat\beta$ much) suggests it is implausible that unobservables can explain away the estimated impact.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Our Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Altonji et al.\ statistic computed from OLS estimates with and without controls for twin predictors is $\sim$2.
\item So for unobservables to explain the OLS coef (-0.12), the variation explained by unobservables would need to be about twice as large as the variation that is explained by the covariates included in our specification.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{IV Estimates}
\frame{\frametitle{IV Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fertility is instrumented with twin-birth
\item Under-estimate trade-off if:
\begin{itemize}
\item twin-birth is endogenous, and
\item Healthier mothers or mothers who invest more pre-birth are more likely to have twins, and
\item These mothers are \emph{also} those who invest more \emph{after} birth
\end{itemize}
\item Demonstrate with observables and Conley bounds

\frame{\frametitle{Taking Stock: OLS vs.\ IV}
\begin{itemize}
\item First stage indicates twin birth is a powerful instrument. 
\item Conditional upon available SES and health controls, the OLS estimate is $-0.08^{*}$ (parity pooled). 
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS estimates are smaller in absolute terms conditional upon mother characteristics. Consistent with high fertility women tending to have lower tastes for education.
\end{itemize}
\item IV estimates are $-0.04^{*}$ (3+, all) to $-0.06^{*}$ (3+, middle income).
\begin{itemize}
\item IV estimates grow larger in absolute terms conditional upon mother characteristics: consistent with our hypothesis. 
\item Trade-off emerges in middle-income countries at 2+ and in middle-inc and pooled sample at 3+ and upwards. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Taking Stock: IV Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trade-off is clearer in middle-income countries
\begin{itemize}
\item Institutional constraints may limit investments in quality in low-income countries.
\end{itemize}
\item Trade-off is smaller in 4+ and 5+ samples
\begin{itemize}
\item These high-fertility families may have different preferences, valuing quality less
\end{itemize}
\item Trade-off is larger and only significant for girls
\begin{itemize}
\item Consistent with girl ``quality'' being more of a luxury
\end{itemize}
\item In 4+ and 5+ samples there is evidence of the trade off being driven by (larger) in families where twins take fertility over the desired level- consistent with our hypothesis
\item Including twins with pre-twins in the sample strengthens the trade-off: they are not fully compensated.

\subsection{Bounds}
\frame{\frametitle{Bounds}
\begin{itemize}
\item IV estimates impose the strong, untestable assumption that twinning is excludable from the 
structural equation
\item We show that this is highly unlikely, even when conditioning on various observable health variables
\item Estimate a $\beta$ interval for a plausible range of $\gamma\neq 0$
\item Can bound in two ways: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS versus IV
\item Loosen the strong assumption of instrumental validity
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{OLS and IV bound the trade-off}
\begin{itemize}
\item High fertility women are negatively selected
\begin{itemize}
\item So controlling for fertility predictors weakens OLS estimates of the QQ trade-off.
\end{itemize}
\item Women predisposed toward having twins are positively selected
\begin{itemize}
\item So controlling for predictors of twin birth strengthens IV estimates of the QQ trade-off.
\end{itemize}
\item This allows us to treat OLS and IV estimates as bounds on the true parameter
\begin{itemize}
\item The caveat to this is that we will tend to under-estimate the lower bound (IV) because it is impossible to fully control for mother characteristics that determine fetal health and predict twinning.
\end{itemize}
\item Can thus tighten bounds (on both sides) by controlling for additional health and socioeconomic variables
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Bounds derived on the premise of plausible exogeneity}
An alternative approach to inference for IV models with instruments whose validity is debatable.
\[
schooling = \beta fertility + \textcolor{red}{\gamma twins} + X\delta+ e
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Relax the exclusion restriction that $\gamma=0$.
\item Plausible exogeneity corresponds to having prior information that $\gamma$ is near 0 but not exactly 0 (Conley et al.\ 2012)
\item The 2SLS estimator is less sensitive to violations of the exclusion restriction when the instrument is strong (related, Bound, Jaeger, Baker 1995). Conley et al.\ are motivated by cases such as ours where the instrument is strong but may not be strictly exogenous.
\item Nevo and Rosen (2012) discuss a similar estimation strategy
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Procedure}
Conley et al. 2012 present four complementary inference strategies that use prior information about $\gamma$ to different extents. We implement two of these: union of confidence interval (UCI) and the local to zero approach (LTZ)
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item We specify a set of plausible values for $\gamma$ and obtain interval estimates for $\beta$ conditional upon each.  Grid over 0 to 2$\hat\gamma$.
\item Taking the union of these interval estimates across values of $\gamma$ provides a conservative interval estimate for $\beta$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The plus is that we don’t need to specify a prior distribution for $\gamma$, just a range of plausible values.
\item The minus is that the estimated interval around $\beta$ may be wide
\end{itemize}
\item The LTZ approach views prior probabilities for $\gamma$ as analogous to objective probabilities in a 2-step DGP.  Here we must specificy a prior distribution.

Similar analysis for \hyperlink{three}{\textcolor{blue}{3+}} and \hyperlink{four}{\textcolor{blue}{4+}} shows similar patterns

\begin{itemize}
\item We can produce much tighter bounds by precisely estimating $\gamma$ and its distribution
\item It is likely that $\gamma$ is only marginally larger than zero
\begin{itemize}
\item This represents the effect of maternal health on child quality, moderated by health's effect on twinning
\end{itemize}
\item Work in progress: use maternal health shock (sulfa expansion in early 20$^{th}$ century) to estimate
effect of health on twinning and child quality (eg Bhalotra and Venkataramani, 2013).  Combining these gives causal estimate of $\gamma$

\begin{itemize}
\item Indicators of mother's health, education, wealth and age are significant predictors of twin birth.
\item As are positive behaviours during pregnancy
\item Families that at some date have a twin have significantly lower infant mortality rates prior to occurrence of twins (consistent with their being healthier).
\item Conditioning upon available twin predictors produces evidence of a trade-off in IV ($\sim -0.04$ s.d.) and RF estimates.
\item Recognizing that twins are at best plausibly exogenous results in a QQ parameter interval with an upper bound of $\sim -0.15$ s.d. 
\item Significantly larger trade-off for middle income countries and for female children
