%== Twins: A Natural Experiment
%================================================================================

\section{Introduction}

\frame{\frametitle{Twins As A Natural Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item A vast literature in economics, behavioural genetics and psychology relies upon the premise that twin births occur as an act of nature -- and are allocated randomly across families.\\ \vspace{5mm}
\item A twin birth generates a natural experiment. 
\begin{itemize}
\item It allows us to compare families that unexpectedly have an additional child because they have a twin birth with families who have the same number of birth events but only singleton births. \\ \vspace{5mm}
\end {itemize} 
\item This is useful when one is interested in identifying causal effects of fertility (number of children) on investments in child quality (e.g. education), or on mothers' workforce participation.
\end{itemize}
}



%================================================================================
%== Twin Births Are Not Random
%================================================================================


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Our Critique: Twin Births Are Not Random}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Even if twin conceptions are `random', twin births are not because taking twins to term depends on health stocks and behaviours of mothers during pregnancy.
  \item If health and health-seeking behaviour are correlated with the outcomes, the natural experiment breaks down.\\ \vspace{5mm}
  \item We present the first evidence that this is a widespread phenomenon in rich and poor countries
  \item In poor countries, many women are severely under-nourished and may not be fit enough to carry twin conceptions to birth, and antenatal services are weak. 
  \item In richer countries, many women engage in risky behaviours and/or experience medical problems in pregnancy.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%================================================================================
%== Mechanism
%================================================================================


\begin{frame}[label=mech1]
  \frametitle{Mechanisms}
  The mechanism we propose is selective foetal death. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Twin conceptions are more demanding of maternal resources \& hence more likely to suffer miscarriage or stillbirth.
  \item About 1 in 8 twin conceptions results in a live birth. 
	\item Spontaneous abortion rate among twins three times that for singletons (Boklage 1990). \\ \vspace{3mm}
  \item Supporting medical evidence: FSH is associated with the risk of dizygotic twins and is more prevalent among heavier and taller women (Li et al.\ 2003, Hall 2003) \\ \vspace{3mm}
  \item We provide evidence in favour of this mechanism.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%================================================================================
%== Invalidity of Twin IV
%================================================================================


\frame{\frametitle{Maternal Health -- Multidimensional, Unobservable}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maternal health and pregnancy behaviours are multidimensional and at best partially observed.
\item Therefore impossible to adjust for them and restore validity of the twin instrument.
\item Examples of unobservables include stress, sleep, breakfast-skipping, folic acid supplementation, pollution exposure.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Maternal Health -- Multidimensional, Unobservable}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another critique argues twin-IV incurs bias by failing to account for reinforcing investments and scale-economies- Rosenzweig \& Zhang 2009, but see Angrist et al. 2010
\item It is also recognized that selection into IVF can lead to selection into twins. Our critique is independent of these other considerations.

\end{itemize}
}


%================================================================================
%== Why Do We Care
%================================================================================

\frame{\frametitle{Relevance of this Critique}
\begin{itemize}
\item The established OLS bias pertains to (negative) selection of women into high fertility.
\item We argue that the twin instrument is biased on account of positive selection of women into twin births. 
%%Damian below this is a long sentence, see if you want to format it somehow.
\item If the correlation of maternal health with the outcomes (labour supply or child quality) is positive, the twin-IV estimator will under-estimate the tradeoffs between fertility and (a) labour supply and (b) child quality.
\item Relevant to lively scholarly and policy interest in the career costs of children (Adda et al. 2015) and the quantity-quality tradeoff (Angrist et al. 2010).  
\item Relevant to policies that for instance are designed to regulate fertility (China vs Italy).
\end{itemize}
}


%================================================================================
%== The Quantity-Quality Tradeoff
%================================================================================

\frame{\frametitle{The Quantity--Quality Trade-off}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this paper, to illustrate the problem, we focus upon the QQ tradeoff.
\item An empirical regularity in cross-section \& time series data is that children from large families have weaker educational outcomes (Hanushek 1992, Blake 1989, Galor 2012). \vspace{3mm}
\item This could signify a QQ trade-off (Becker and Lewis 1973, Becker and Tomes 1976) or, alternatively, shift factors like income. \vspace{3mm}
\item Evidence ambiguous: Using the twin instrument Angrist et al.\ 2010, Black et al.\ 2005 reject the Q-Q tradeoff, but Cohen et al. 2013 for instance do not. \vspace{3mm}
\item We argue that an underlying trade-off is veiled by the IV-bias created by omitted maternal health. 
\end{itemize}
}


%================================================================================
%== What We Do
%================================================================================

\frame{\frametitle{What We Do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate that twin births are correlated with maternal health using cross-sectional and within-mother variation in microdata from many countries.
\item Provide evidence of the driving mechanism i.e. that twin births are more likely to miscarry, and especially among less healthy women. \vspace{3mm}
 
\item Present OLS \& IV estimates. The true estimate will lie between the OLS and IV estimates if fertility is negatively selected.
\item Demonstrate (partial) bias-correction following (partial) adjustment for maternal health and other characteristics.
%\item Adjustment for maternal characteristics will narrow the gap [bounds] between the OLS and IV estimates.
\item Estimate bounds on the IV estimates on premise that twins are plausibly (rather than strictly) exogenous (Conley et al. 2012).
\item Provide estimates for the USA and a pooled sample of developing countries.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data}

\begin{frame}[label=data]
  \frametitle{Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Large samples are useful given twins are rare (around 2\%) 
\item This said, twins are not as rare as we may think: 1 in 80 livebirths, so 1 in 40 babies is a twin.
\item Comparable cross-country micro-data for developing countries
\item Surveys conducted 1991-2013: sample of $\sim$3m.\ children born in 68 countries. Birth cohorts 1971-2012 (condition on country and birth cohort FE)
\item American National Health Interview Surveys conducted 1997-2013 
\item Administrative birth registries and surveys from the USA, UK, Scotland, Sweden, Chile, Spain.

\begin{itemize}
%\item Within-mother microdata evidence from poor countries. 
\item Consider women with at least two births. 
\item Define treated as women who have a twin at 2nd birth and control as women who have a singleton at 2nd birth.
\item Compare infant mortality among first births for treated vs control women.

\begin{enumerate}
%\item Cross-sectional microdata evidence from many rich and poor countries.
\item Regress twin birth on indicators of maternal health, $\bm{H}$ (height, BMI during pregnancy, antenatal care availability, smoking/drinking/drugs and medical problems prior to pregnancy)  
\item Condition upon $\bm{X}$ -- age, parity, race, ethnicity -- which geneticists have associated with twinning.    \vspace{3mm}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twinreg}
P(twin_{j})=\gamma_0 + \bm{X}\bm{\gamma}_1 + \bm{H}\bm{\gamma}_2 + \varepsilon_{j}.
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item If twin birth is a random event $\bm{\gamma_2}=0$. 
\item Equivalent to a test for balance of characteristics of `treated' (with twins) and `control' (without twins) mothers.
\item Repeat for cohorts born prior to introduction of IVF.
\item Add controls for $\bm{S}$ -- wealth, education -- to make sure H is not just proxying SES.

%% Then --after-- the main results showing Pr(twin) depends on maternal health; below, add Fig 2 and 3 from Nature showing relation of phenomena with income etc.
%%Sonia: Can you check if this is what you mean?  I am not sure if you mean first put the plot showing all effects of height by country, and then later, the plot of height with GDP (which is what I have now), or first have the top plot of the forest plot that is currently figure 1 in Nature (eg only the section with USA with variables), and then later put the other two plots.  If it is the second option, I can change very quickly.

%==Effect Sizes and Relation to Other birth outcomes
%================================================================================
%% Damian would be good to add a few other effect sizes below esp for smoking, drinking, maybe antental care. If we can do the Pietro index then that too, maybe on a new slide including method.
%%RESPONSE: Yes, good point.  I will make some notes.  We have all the standardised effect sizes in various Nature tables now (Extended Data tables 3-6), so shouldn't take long to focus on the ones we want.

\begin{frame}[label=effects]
\frametitle{Effect Sizes}
We find substantial marginal effects of observed indicators of mother’s health on the probability of twin births (mean$\approx$2\%)
This relationship holds across countries with very different levels of income.
\begin{itemize}
\item No previous evidence of maternal health being a predictor of twin births.
\item But our findings are in line with maternal health and behaviours affecting other birth outcomes e.g. birth weight or Pr(boys) 
\item Mazumder and Seeskin, 2014; Black et al.\ 2014;  Bhalotra and Rawlings 2013; Almond et al.\ 2011; Barker 1995.
%%Damian we need to update the statements below to indicate at least the DHS and USA results i think they are currently just the dhs figures and not sure if they are consistent with latest tables.
  \item $\Delta^+$ 1 s.d.\ height of mother $\rightarrow$ $\Delta^+$ twin 0.2-0.6\% 
  \item $\Delta^-$ 1 s.d.\ proportion of underweight mothers $\rightarrow$ $\Delta^+$ twin 0.10-0.20\%
  \item $\Delta^-$ 1 s.d.\ proportion of mothers smoking $\rightarrow$ $\Delta^+$ twin 0.20-0.35\%
  \item $\Delta^-$ 1 s.d.\ proportion of chronic disease $\rightarrow$ $\Delta^+$ twin 0.02-0.38\%
  \item All of these effects are based on a baseline rate of twins of about 2-3\%
  \item Twin mothers are \hyperlink{factors}{\textcolor{blue}{3-16\% of a s.d.\ healthier}} than non-twin mothers

%%Damian i had trouble with hyperlinks in Essen. One problem is how to get back to where i was from the table i am jumped to by the link. If easy to fix/explain then good to keep these links.
%%if not then let's display the table here and i can flip through it quickly given too many slides.
%%RESPONSE: I will add a "back" hyperlink on each table.  Maybe it's best to put all these tables at the end like an appendix, and then you can just jump to some examples to make the country-specific point?  This way you don't have to scroll through all, and the return can be easy with the "back" hyperlink. 
%%thanks Damian that sounds good

%%Damian below we mention Nepal, Spain but didnt we have miscarriage for the USA too? If yes can we add it here?
%% Damian would be good to add effect sizes below.
%%RESPONSE: Yes, the USA test looks quite good.  We also have the double-difference style graphs and table from the Nature paper, which to me seems more compelling.  Note that this is dated and we have to take out the Nepal results.  A while ago we realised that they were problematic given that all we had was whether the mother had ever had any miscarriage, not whether a particular pregnancy was a miscarriage, so the essence of the test was lost.
%% thanks Damian- good to replace Nepal with US then. for Nature i like the histograms but for econ i think the regression interaction with a t-stat attd to it is stronger evidence. in the plots we %have the t-test for each pair but not for the difference across pairs which economists would want to see.

\begin{frame}[label=mech]
\frametitle{Mechanisms -- Miscarriage}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is hard to find data on twin conceptions and on miscarriage. 
\item We found relevant data from \hyperlink{TwinDeathUSA}{USA} and \hyperlink{TwinDeathSpain}{\textcolor{blue}{Spain}} which establish that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Miscarriage is more frequent among less healthy women (health indicated by under-weight, short, hypertension, etc.)
\item[(ii)] Miscarriage is more frequent among twins
\item[(iii)] Miscarriage is most frequent among less healthy women carrying twins

%%On another matter - Damian- i like figure 6 in the Paper- can you put it below?
%%RESPONE.  DONE.

\begin{frame}[label=selectest]
  \frametitle{Potential Concern: Selection on Maternal Survival}
\begin{itemize}
\item If unhealthy women who delivered twins died in childbirth, the (DHS) data will not contain those mothers or births.
\item So our observation that twin birth is correlated with maternal health may be driven by selection on maternal survival. 
%%Damian is this also true in the US data? It is true in DHS because mother is respondent. But if US is hospital data then they would record the births even if the mother died?
%%RESPONSE: In the USA birth data, the birth *would* be recorded even if the mother died, given that as you say it's vital statistics.  If mother and child died, we would also see this in the fetal death file. 
%%DAMIAN- but for mothers who died, if we record a birth, would we still have a record of the mothers health characteristics even though she died (because the charac were presumably noted during her antenatal visits before birth. if yes then we can claim that there is no selection problem in our US estimates.
\item We (over-)correct for this
\item Basic idea: assume that all women with poor health stocks who died would have had twins, and add these back into the sample to see if this alters substantive findings. \hyperlink{MMRselec}{\beamergotobutton{Full procedure description}}

\item We compute Altonji-Taber type bounds on OLS estimates.

%== IV - Standard
%================================================================================

%%Damian i moved things around between this and next slide i hope i didnt mess up the syntax

\frame{\frametitle{IV Procedure}
Fertility is often instrumented with occurence of a twin birth. 
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:secondstage}
educ_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 fert_{j} + \bm{X}\bm{\beta}_2+u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:firststage}
fert_{j}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 twins_{j}+\bm{X}\bm{\alpha}_2+\nu_{j},
\end{equation}
\vspace{2mm}
This asssumes:
\[
\mathbb{E}[fert_j\cdot u_{ij}] \neq 0, \ \mathbb{E}[twins_j\cdot u_{ij}] = 0
\]
\vspace{6mm}

Assuming additive separability of $u_{ij}$: $u_{ij}=u_{ij}^S+u_{ij}^H+u_{ij}^*$.  The typical IV estimate is 
then the population value, plus (unobserved) error components:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV} = \beta_1 + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^S_{ij} + 
P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^H_{ij} + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^*_{ij}
\]
}


%================================================================================
%== IV - Inconsistency
%================================================================================

%% Damian - maybe replace with the new methodology section that we discussed.
%%RESPONSE: Yes, to be edited!

\frame{\frametitle{Addressing Inconsistency of Twin-IV- Refurbish Covariates}
By including $H$ as controls in, we remove observables from the error term and the IV estimate becomes:
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H} = \beta_1 + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^*_{ij},
\]
\vspace{3mm}
where it is likely that $\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,H}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.$

\begin{spacing}{1.2}
But maternal health and pregnancy behaviours are multidimensional and only ever partially unobserved. 
In order to put limits on the inconsistency, we use partial identification and bounds techniques
\end{spacing}
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item With some conditions, bound between (upward biased) OLS and (downward biased) IV
\item Combine IV with Conley et al 2012 bounds (similar to Rosen and Nevo 2012)

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Predictions are for infra-marginal children.
%\end{itemize}
%\item Restricting to pre-twins avoids selection problems that arise because families who choose to have another child after a twin birth may differ from families who choose to have another child after a singleton birth.
\item Restrict to families with at least $j$ births to ensure that fertility preferences are the same in families with twins at the $j^{th}$ birth as for families with singletons at order $j$. \vspace{3mm}
\item The ``2+ sample'' consists of firstborn subjects in families with at least two births. 
\begin{itemize}
\item In this sample, we instrument with twins at second birth

%\item A large ratio arises if adding controls does not change $\hat\beta$ much.
 %suggests it is implausible that unobservables can explain away the estimated impact.
\item Our estimate is about $\sim$2. So for unobservables to explain the OLS coefficient, the variation explained by unobservables would need to be about twice as large as the variation that is explained by the covariates included in our specification.
\item This suggests the presence of a genuine trade-off.

\textbf{Developing Countries}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Education: OLS $-0.1^{*}$ (parity pooled), smaller conditional on mother characteristics. 
\item IV $-0.04^{*}$ (3+, all) to $-0.07^{*}$ (3+, middle income), larger conditional on mother characteristics. 
\end{itemize}       
 \vspace{5mm}
  
%%Damian we need to add the effect sizes here, if in paper i will add in next round. Need to be sure i know the units/ if standardized
\textbf{United States}
\begin{itemize}
\item Education: OLS $-0.03^{*}$ estimates with/without conditioning 
\item IV (3+, all) estimates $-0.005/0.01$ with/without conditioning
\item Health: OLS $-0.001/-0.005^{*}$ estimates with/without conditioning
\item IV (3+, all) estimates $-0.04/-0.06^{*}$ with/without conditioning
\item First stage indicates twin birth is a powerful instrument, coefficient 0.8 in developing countries, 0.7 in USA.

An approach to inference for IV models with instruments whose validity is debatable.
\[
quality = \beta fertility + \textcolor{red}{\gamma twins} + X\delta+ e
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Relax the exclusion restriction that $\gamma=0$.
\item Plausible exogeneity corresponds to having prior information that $\gamma$ is near 0 but not exactly 0 (Conley et al.\ 2012).
\item \emph{If} we are able to say something about $\gamma$, this allows for valid inference even when traditional IV assumptions fail.
\item This is akin to pushing off identification by one stage: when exclusion restriction fails, we need to know how it fails.
\item This strategy works particularly well when the instrument is strong, so 2SLS is less sensitive to violations (related, Bound, Jaeger, Baker 1995). Ours is such a case.
\item Similar strategy in Nevo and Rosen (2012).

%== Bounds - Conley procedures
%================================================================================

%%Damian is going to rewrite the next few slides and add one each on the procedures for estimating gamma from nigeria and usasulfa data.

\frame{\frametitle{Procedures}
Conley et al. 2012 present four complementary inference strategies that use prior information about $\gamma$ to different extents. We implement two of these: union of confidence interval (UCI) and the local to zero approach (LTZ).
\vspace{6mm} \\
\textbf{Union of Confidence Intervals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify a set of plausible values for $\gamma$ and obtain interval estimates for $\beta$ conditional upon each.
\item Taking the union of these interval estimates across values of $\gamma$ provides a conservative interval estimate for $\beta$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The plus is that we don't need to specify a prior distribution for $\gamma$, just a range of plausible values.
\item The minus is that the estimated interval around $\beta$ may be wide
\item Also, the union for $\gamma$ may be ad-hoc (see also discussion in Nevo and Rosen)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Procedures}
Conley et al. 2012 present four complementary inference strategies that use prior information about $\gamma$ to different extents. We implement two of these: union of confidence interval (UCI) and the local to zero approach (LTZ).
\vspace{4mm} \\
\textbf{Local to Zero Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item The LTZ approach views prior probabilities for $\gamma$ as analogous to objective probabilities in a 2-step DGP.  Here we must specificy a prior distribution.
\item Essentially, we must posit a distribution for $\gamma$ which describes the real world.  ``Nature'' draws from this distribution, and the remainder of the DGP follows from the value drawn.
\item This leaves much more space for violation of the exclusion restriction
\item And if we know the true distribution of $\gamma$, this buys us consistent estimates of $\beta$
\end{itemize}

%%Damian to add results not only on bounds as below but also on the 2 components of gamma, the plot of the distribution.. maybe with hyperlinks going fwd and back.

\begin{frame}[label=gammaDiscuss]
  \frametitle{Estimating $\gamma$}
From the structural equation, we know that $\gamma=\frac{\partial quality}{\partial twins}$.  The exclusion restriction fails because twin mothers are healthier than non-twin mothers, and the additional maternal health leads to greater child quality outcomes.
\vspace{4mm} \\

\textbf{How can we estimate $\gamma$?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We use a well known historical reform (sulfa drugs) to causally estimate the effect of mother's health on child outcomes ($\partial quality/\partial health$)
  \item Sulfonamide drugs reduced morbidity/mortality due to infectious diseases
  \item This is scaled by the degree to which twin mothers are healthier than non-twin mothers when considering \emph{the same} health measure ($health_{twin=1}-health_{twin=0}=\partial health/\partial twin$)
  \item The product of these estimates gives $\hat\gamma$ %(\hyperlink{gammaEst}{\textcolor{blue}{estimates}})
  \item We then use resampling methods to calculate the full distribution for $\gamma$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=gammaEst1]
  \frametitle{Estimated $\gamma$ from Sulfonamide Introduction}
  Using census data from the USA, follow Bhalotra and Venkataramani and estimate:
  \[
  quality^k_{st} = \alpha + \phi(Post_t\times Pneumonia_s^m)+\lambda_s+\eta_t + \varepsilon_{st}
  \]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Here $quality^k$ is outcome for children ($k$), and $Pneumonia^m$ captures exogenous decreases of rates of pneumonia reduction when the mother ($m$) was exposed in her life
  \item Difference-in-difference estimates of $\hat\phi$ thus quantify how an exogenous increase in health (lower morbidity from pneumonia in mother's life) affects her childrens' health
  \item Finally, we must estimate the difference in rates of pneumonia exposure between twin and non-twin mothers.
  \item This scales the parameter $\hat\phi$ to give the change in quality due to the health advantage enjoyed by twin mothers
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=gammaEst]
  \frametitle{Estimated $\gamma$ from Sulfonamide Introduction}
  \input{./tables/gamma.tex}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We estimate that $\gamma$ is quite small: less than 1\% of 1 standard deviation
  \item This is considerably smaller than point estimates of the Q--Q trade-off from earlier
  \item We can observe the entire distribution of $\gamma$ using \hyperlink{gammaResamp}{\textcolor{blue}{resampling methods}}
  \item Note that we take the absolute value of $\gamma$ as increasing health is \emph{reduction} in pneumonia, so column 2 should be expressed in terms of \emph{not} having suffered the condition

%================================================================================
\section{Conclusions}
\frame{\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Indicators of mother's health and pregnancy behaviours are significant predictors of twin birth.
\item Conditioning upon available twin predictors produces evidence of a trade-off in IV ($\sim -0.04$ s.d.\ education in developing countries, 0.06 s.d.\ health in USA).
\item Recognizing that twins are at best plausibly exogenous results in a QQ parameter interval with an upper bound of $\sim -0.08$ s.d.\ (developing) $\sim -0.15$ s.d.\ (USA) 
\item In some cases, bounds can be estimated quite tightly and are informative: bounded to within 0.06 of a s.d.\ in developing countries, 0.08 of a s.d.\ in USA 
\item Ignoring the twin bias will similarly tend to lead to under-estimation of the trade-off between fertility and women's labour force participation.

\frametitle{Height and Selective Maternal Survival (1)} 
\begin{itemize}
\item We use unique data on maternal mortality rates of sisters of female respondents in the DHS.
\item We count the number of `unhealthy' women whose sisters died ($N_u$) and the number of `healthy' women whose sisters died ($N_h$).
\item We assume $N_u > N_h$ given that our data show that maternal mortality (of sisters) depends upon height (assumes height correlated across sisters).
\item First, we expand our sample to include $N_u + N_h$ women, choosing them randomly from within our file, based upon their `health'.
\item We use different measures of `health' to check sensitivity of results to this. We use different thresholds and combine being short and being underweight.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Height and Selective Maternal Survival (2)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Second, we assume that the unhealthy women who died in childbirth were all carrying twins and that the healthy women who died in childbirth were all carrying singletons. 
\item This is an extreme assumption intended to produce a severe test of selection.
\item We then re-estimate the regression of prob(twin) on indicators of mother's health using the simulated sample.
\item We continue to find significant impacts of maternal health on twinning probabilities. So selection is not driving our results.
\item We should note how much the coef on maternal health change so that we can say something about the size of the selection effect.

\item $\hat\theta^H = f(height,weight,smoking,conditions,\ldots)$
