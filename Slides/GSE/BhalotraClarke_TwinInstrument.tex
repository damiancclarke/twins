\section{Motivation}
\frame{\frametitle{The Quantity--Quality Tradeoff}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Cross-sectional data within and across regions suggests that children from larger families have weaker educational outcomes, e.g. Hanushek 1992, Blake 1989.
 \item This empirical regularity is often attributed to a quantity-quality (QQ) tradeoff in parental investments: Becker 1960, Becker and Lewis 1973, Becker and Tomes 1976.
 \item Child quality and child quantity enter multiplicatively in the budget constraint. It follows that (Galor 2012)- 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Exogenous reductions in the price of quality raise the shadow price of having more children.
 \item \textcolor{red}{Exogenous reductions in the price of quantity (of children) reduce the marginal cost of investing in quality}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Relevance}
\begin{itemize}
\item The negative reinforcing mechanism between q \& q plays a central role in macro-growth models with endogenous fertility.
\begin{itemize}
\item Becker and Barro 1988, Becker et al. 1990, Moav 2005.
\end{itemize}
\item Many countries have implemented aggressive fertility control policies, e.g. China, India, Mexico, Indonesia.
\begin{itemize}
\item Echoes Malthus.
\item Idea is that this is good for human capital and growth.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Evidence}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Limited causal evidence}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Limitations of causal evidence}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Overall, some doubt that a QQ tradeoff exists}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Using twins as an instrument}, Black et al. 2005 (Norway) and Angrist et al. 2010 (Israel) find no evidence of a relationship between fertility and schooling.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some evidence of a trade off using other quality indicators: Juhn et. al. 2013, Conley and Glauber 2006, Caceres-Delpiano 2006.
\end{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Using change in price of quality}, recent studies find a trade off: Bleakley 2007, Bhalotra and Venkataramani 2012, Aaranson et al. 2013 
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Our Contributions}
We argue that an underlying QQ tradeoff may be obscured.
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Twin birth is not exogenous (even if twin conception is)}
\begin{itemize}
\item In particular, the health of the mother is a potential omitted variable in previous studies.
\item Existing estimates are biased, inconsistent
\item We show that this is the case in a wide range of contexts (Chile, USA, Scotland, DHS\ldots)
\end{itemize}
\item We assemble a large micro-data sample for developing countries and assess whether the tradeoff is evident in \textcolor{blue}{poorer} countries.
\begin{itemize}
\item Previous work has argued that credit constraints on investment in child quality may not be binding in richer countries
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Motivation}
\frame{\frametitle{IV Procedure}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:secondstage}
educ_{ij}=\beta_0+\beta_1 fert_{j} + \bm{X}\bm{\beta}_2+u_{ij}.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:firststage}
fert_{j}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 twins_{j}+\bm{X}\bm{\alpha}_2+\nu_{j},
\end{equation}
\vspace{2mm}
And so assuming:
\[
E[fert_j\cdot u_{ij}] \neq 0, \ E[twins_j\cdot u_{ij}] = 0
\]
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Previous studies assume twin incidence is a valid instrument.
\item A key concern is whether IV estimates are precise enough to be informative (and distinguishable from OLS estimates): Angrist et al.\ 2010.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Twin Exogeneity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textcolor{blue}{Refurbish $\bm{X}$}.  Ours is the first attempt to condition on (partial indicators) of mother's health
\item \textcolor{blue}{Estimate bounds} on qq-parameter when twin instrument is almost but not exactly exogenous.
\end{enumerate}
Thereby assess possibility that there is a QQ tradeoff, obscured in recent studies by bias associated with assuming twin exogeneity.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Twin Exogeneity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assuming additive separability of $u_{ij}$: $u_{ij}=u_{ij}^S+u_{ij}^H+u_{ij}^*$
\item `typical estimate': 
\end{itemize}
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV} = \beta_1 + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^S_{ij} + 
P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^H_{ij} + P\lim \frac{1}{N}twin_ju^*_{ij}
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item By including elements $S$ and $H$ in $\bm{X}$, this becomes:
\end{itemize}
\[
\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H} = \beta_1 + P\lim N^{-1}twin_ju^*_{ij},
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item where it is likely that $\hat\beta_1^{IV}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,H}>\hat\beta_1^{IV,S+H}>\beta_1.$
\end{itemize}
}

%\frame{\frametitle{Innovation 2: Desired Fertility}
%Use information on \textcolor{blue}{twin parity relative to target fertility}.
%\vspace{5mm}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The Wald estimator is the weighted average causal response for people from families induced by an instrum%ent to go from having fewer than j to at least j children, weighted over j by the probability of crossing this %threshold. 
%\item The denominator normalizing the weights is the Wald first stage.
%\item Individuals with $C_{1i} \geq j \geq C_{0i}$ are compliers a la Angirst, Imbens, Rubin 1996. Differences %in 1st stage coefficients indicate differences in probability of compliance across groups.
%\end{itemize}
%}


\section{Data}
\frame{\frametitle{Data and Context}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparable cross-country micro-data for developing countries from the Demographic and Health Surveys
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete fertility histories, subjective reports of desired fertility, indicators of maternal health, maternal education and child education.
\end{itemize}
\item Merge all surveys between 1991 and 2013: sample of 2,721,619 children from 68 countries
\begin{itemize}
\item Large sample useful given twin are rare (sample mean 1.89\%)
\item Outcome: schooling (z-score). Retain children age 6-17 at survey date.
\item Birth cohorts 1971-2012
\end{itemize}
\item Countries classified as low vs middle income by the World Bank
\begin{itemize}
\item Women in poor countries under-nourished and less able to take twin conceptions to term. Higher desired fertility, twins are less likely than otherwise to take actual over desired fertility. Low schooling.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Data and Context}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{Effects of twins at parity $j$ on outcomes for births $j-1$ and before} (as in Black et al. 2005). 
\begin{itemize}
\item Predictions are for \textcolor{red}{infra-marginal} children.
\end{itemize}
\item Nomenclature: ``2+ sample'' - Firstborn subjects in families with at least two births (allowing that a birth may be twin). 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instrument with twins at second birth
\end{itemize}
\item ``3+ sample'': First and second born subjects in families with at least three births 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instrument with twins at third birth
\end{itemize}
\item And simiarly for 4+.  Twin subjects are generally dropped.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
\item By restricting to \textcolor{blue}{families with at least $j$ births} on average we ensure that preferences over family size are the same in the families with twins at the $jth$ birth and those with singleton births
\item By restricting the sample to \textcolor{blue}{children born before birth $j$}, we avoid selection problems that arise because families who choose to have another child after a twin birth may differ from families who choose to have another child after a singleton birth.
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Twin Births Are Correlated With Mother Characteristics}
\frame{\frametitle{Mother's Health}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Evidence from the cross-country microdata sample shows that indicators of the health of the mother influence child birth-weight, survival and growth (stunting): Bhalotra and Rawlings (2013). 
 \item This makes it plausible that mother’s health influences foetal survival.
\begin{itemize}
 \item A standard deviation decrease in mother's height or BMI raises the risk of poor child health (birth-weight, mortality, stunting) by between 5 and 10 per cent, depending on the measure.
\item The risks of low birth weight and neonatal mortality are higher by 5.7\% and 16.9\% of their mean rates amongst mothers who have anemia relative to mothers who do not.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Mother's Health}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{No previous evidence (or discussion) of maternal health being a predictor of twin births.}
\item But, recognised that maternal health and behaviours affects a large number of other birth and longer term outcomes (Mazumder and Seeskin, 2014; Black et al.\ 2014; Almond et al.\ 2011; Barker 1995).
\item And evidence from medical literature (Li et al.\ 2003, Hall 2003) that Pr(twinning) increases with age, weight and height (mediated by follicle stimulating hormone) 
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{\frametitle{Investigating Exogeneity of Twins -- 1}
\begin{equation}
\label{TWINeqn:twinreg}
P(twin_{j})=\gamma_0 + \bm{X}\bm{\gamma}_1 + \bm{S}\bm{\gamma}_2
                  + \bm{H}\bm{\gamma}_3 + \varepsilon_{j}.
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Equivalent: \textcolor{blue}{Test of balance} of characteristics (X) between mothers who have twins and mothers who do not
\item $\bm{X}, \bm{S}$ and $\bm{H}$ are mother characteristics potentially correlated with child quality: age, wealth, education, height, BMI, antenatal care, smoking/drinking/drugs during pregnancy.
\item If twin birth is a random event $\bm{\gamma_1}=\bm{\gamma_2}=\bm{\gamma_3}=0$
\item \textcolor{red}{Can typically condition on only a subset of predictors $X$}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Investigating Exogeneity of Twins -- 2: Women who have twin births are healthier}
\[Quality_{t-k}=\alpha twins_{t}+\bm{X}\delta + \varepsilon \]
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare child quality in families with and without twins at parity $p$ for children born at earlier parities. 
\item But use a measure of quality (investment) that is necessarily determined before twins occur: infant mortality.
\item If twins occur randomly, $\alpha=0$
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Effect Sizes}
Substantial marginal effects of observed indicators of mother’s health on the probability of twin birth (mean=2\%)
\vspace{6mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item A one s.d. change in the height of the mother results in an increase of 0.44\% points (22\% of mean)
\item A one s.d. change in mother’s BMI results in an increase of 0.20\% points (10\% of mean)
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Is This an Artifact of DHS Data?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item DHS (above)
  \item Chile
  \item Scotland
  \item UK

\begin{itemize}

\item Drinking while pregnant is significantly negatively related to having a twin
\item Smoking while pregnant is significantly negatively related to having a twin
\item Age, race and more previous births are significant predictors
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Second Test of Exogeneity of Twins: Are mothers who produce twins healthier ex ante?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of child outcome determined before twins arise across families who do and do not subsequently have a twin birth
\item Results indicate that twin births occur in families with a tendency towards lower infant morality, possibly healthier (or better-off) families.

\section{Results}
\subsection{OLS Estimates}
\frame{\frametitle{OLS Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS estimates will over-estimate the size of the trade-off if fertility and investments in children are simultaneously determined
\item Similarly, parental heterogeneity by fertility level will bias estimates (Qian, 2005)
\item Can use the Altonji-Taber statistic to assess the chance that the estimated trade-off is entirely spurrious
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{OLS Estimates}
Adding controls for predictors of twin birth diminishes the estimated trade-off
\input{./tables/OLS.tex}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Altonji, Elder, Taber 2005, extension in Bellows and Miguel 2009}
\[
schooling = \beta fertility+ X\delta + e
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Fertility is endogenous and instrumented by twins and $X$ is a vector of relevant controls, conditional upon which twins are a valid instrument.
\item \textcolor{red}{Suppose we observe only a random sub-set of $X$.}
\item Assume that the observed and unobserved components of X are correlated and selection on unobservables is similar to selection on observables.
\item Compute the ratio of $\beta_c/(\beta_n-\beta_c)$ . A large ratio (given by controls not changing $\beta$ much) suggests it is implausible that unobservables can explain away the estimated impact.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Our Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Altonji et al.\ statistic computed from OLS estimates with and without controls for twin predictors is $\sim$2.
\item So for unobservables to explain the OLS coef (-0.12), the variation explained by unobservables would need to be about twice as large as the variation that is explained by the covariates included in our specification.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{IV Estimates}
\frame{\frametitle{IV Estimates}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fertility is instrumented with twin-birth
\item Under-estimate trade-off if twin-birth is endogenous
\item Demonstrate with observables and Conley bounds
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The incidence of twins predicts an increase in fertility of $\sim$0.8 children (Similar if completed fertility)}

\input{./tables/IVTogether.tex}
}

\frame{\frametitle{IV Results by Gender}
\input{./tables/Gender.tex}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Taking Stock: OLS vs.\ IV}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{First stage} indicates twin birth is a powerful instrument. 
\item Conditional upon available SES and health controls, the OLS estimate is $-0.08^{*}$ (parity pooled). 
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS estimates are smaller in absolute terms conditional upon mother characteristics. Consistent with high fertility women tending to have lower tastes for education.
\end{itemize}
\item IV estimates are $-0.04^{*}$ (3+, all) to $-0.06^{*}$ (3+, middle income). 
\begin{itemize}
\item IV estimates grow larger in absolute terms conditional upon mother characteristics: consistent with our hypothesis. 
\item Trade-off emerges in middle-income countries at 2+ and in middle-inc and pooled sample at 3+ and upwards. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Taking Stock: IV Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Trade-off is clearer in middle-income countries
\begin{itemize}
\item Institutional constraints may limit investments in quality in low-income countries.
\end{itemize}
\item Trade-off is smaller in 4+ and 5+ samples
\begin{itemize}
\item These high-fertility families may have different preferences, valuing quality less
\end{itemize}
\item Trade-off is larger and only significant for girls
\begin{itemize}
\item Consistent with girl ``quality'' being more of a luxury
\end{itemize}
\item In 4+ and 5+ samples there is evidence of the trade off being driven by (larger) in families where twins take fertility over the desired level- consistent with our hypothesis
\item Including twins with pre-twins in the sample strengthens the trade-off: they are not fully compensated.
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Bounds}
\frame{\frametitle{Bounds}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate a $\beta$ interval for a plausible range of $\gamma\neq 0$
\item Can bound in two ways: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS versus IV
\item Loosen the strong assumption of instrumental validity
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{OLS and IV bound the tradeoff }
\begin{itemize}
\item High fertility women are \textcolor{red}{negatively selected}
\begin{itemize}
\item So controlling for fertility predictors weakens OLS estimates of the QQ tradeoff.
\end{itemize}
\item Women who are predisposed toward having twins are \textcolor{red}{positively selected}
\begin{itemize}
\item So controlling for predictors of twin birth strengthens IV estimates of the QQ tradeoff.
\end{itemize}
\item This allows us to treat OLS and IV estimates as bounds on the true parameter
\begin{itemize}
\item The caveat to this is that we will tend to under-estimate the lower bound (IV) because it is impossible to fully control for mother characteristics that determine fetal health and predict twinning.
\end{itemize}
\item Can thus tighten bounds (on both sides) by controlling for additional health and socioeconomic variables
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Bounds derived on the premise of plausible exogeneity}
An alternative approach to inference for IV models with instruments whose validity is debatable.
\[
schooling = \beta fertility + \textcolor{red}{\gamma twins} + X\delta+ e
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Relax the exclusion restriction that $\gamma=0$.
\item Plausible exogeneity corresponds to having prior information that $\gamma$ is near 0 but not exactly 0 (Conley et al.\ 2012)
\item The \textcolor{red}{2SLS estimator is less sensitive to violations of the exclusion restriction when the instrument is strong} (related, Bound, Jaeger, Baker 1995). Conley et al.\ are motivated by cases such as ours where the instrument is strong but may not be strictly exogenous.
\item Nevo and Rosen (2012) discuss a similar estimation strategy
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Procedure}
Conley et al. 2012 present four complementary inference strategies that use prior information about $\gamma$ to different extents. We implement two of these: union of confidence interval (UCI) and the local to zero approach (LTZ)
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item We specify a set of plausible values for $\gamma$ and obtain interval estimates for $\beta$ conditional upon each.  Grid over 0 to 2$\hat\gamma$.
\item Taking the union of these interval estimates across values of $\gamma$ provides a conservative interval estimate for $\beta$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The plus is that we don’t need to specify a prior distribution for $\gamma$, just a range of plausible values.
\item The minus is that the estimated interval around $\beta$ may be wide
\end{itemize}
\item The LTZ approach views prior probabilities for $\gamma$ as analogous to objective probabilities in a 2-step DGP.  Here we must specificy a prior distribution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\frame{\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Indicators of mother's health, education, wealth and age are significant predictors of twin birth.
\item As are positive behaviours during pregnancy
\item Families that at some date have a twin have significantly lower infant mortality rates prior to occurrence of twins (consistent with their being healthier).
\item Conditioning upon available twin predictors produces evidence of a tradeoff in IV ($\sim -0.04$ s.d.) and RF estimates.
\item Recognizing that twins are at best plausibly exogenous results in a QQ parameter interval with an upper bound of $\sim -0.15$ s.d. 
\item Significantly larger trade-off for middle income countries and for female children
