COMMENTS FOR TWIN PREDICT REGRESSIONS

2012/11/03
	- Added tables for twin predict using DHS and Chilean (ELPI) data
	- Added table for terminated pregnancy (any) on observable characteristics
	using DHS data.  One point to keep in mind here is that the question is not
	explicit about pregnancies terminated in case of abortions, versus those
	terminated by miscarriage
		> Also included do files to set-up and run regressions for the previous
		three results (twin predict DHS, twin predict Chile, terminated pregnancy
		predict DHS)
