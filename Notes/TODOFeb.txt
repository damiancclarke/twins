TO DO February 2014: Twins
================================================================================

ECONOMICS
(1)  Implement Conley et al IV bounds alternative estimations (2-4)
     > Should actually re-write Stata routines.  Current versions on Conley's
       site do not work in many cases
(2)  Comprehensive test for balance between treatment and control              X
     > do files exist, remake source and add further vars		                   X
     > Full description, 10/01 email from Sonia	     			                     X
(3)  Re-run all main tests including bord dummies (a-la Black et al)	         X
(4)  Control for birth-spacing (RZ is reference, plus point from Sonia's notes)X
(5)  Make table for IMR placebo equation, add column for birth-spacing controls
(6)  Show results for twins themselves
(7)  Test whether crossing desired threshold by parity depends upon Xs				 X
     > Point from Sonia's email (10/01) should be incorporated: F test of jointX 
	 vars																																				 X
(8)  Look particularly at families in bottom wealth quintil/quartile?          X
     > Problem is that this isn't recorded for many DHS                        X
     > Still, can probably do given sample-size (checked, actually about 1/2)	 X
(9)  Policy experiments to see Q-Q in a particular case (ie school construction)
(10) Check to see if Angrist et al and Black et al uploaded data to JoLE, QJE
     > Not on Angrist data archive
     > JOLE says that yes, but can't find where to download
     > Can't find on QJE either...
     > As Sonia says, we can request from authors when sending a draft
(11) Think about sex-selection instrument??  Black et al don't like it...
(12) Discuss Cheti Nicoletti's email - run these tests?

================================================================================
SCIENCE
(1)  Add IFLS regression...
(2)  Can we get UK/Denmark data (Sonia)
(3)  Comprehensive summary statistics on twins across low-/high-income countries
     > This is a really nice point!  (From Sonia's notes)
     > Include prevalance, bwt, IMR, trends over time
(4) Add antenatal care/midwife in mother's region to twin regressions

This paper is something that is perhaps best with 2 datasets, or at most 3.  I
guess this is why we are thinking DHS + Norway/USA etc.  If we have relatively
few words and want to say something like (a) twins look like the following (show
sum stats), (b) twins depend upon family characteristics, and (c) twins matter
as they have effect on (global) family outcomes, then this is already *a lot* in
not many words and restriction on number of figures/tables...
