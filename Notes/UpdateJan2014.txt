TABLES:
1) Typical Q-Q IV setup, adding socioeconomic and then health controls
2) The same table as in 1, but also includes twins in estimation sample
3) The same table as in 1, but re-estimating for:
  	- low income countries
	- middle income countries
4) Interaction of fertility with twin taking family over desired level
5) Above, but estimating only for those who desire same family size
6) Re-estimate these for:
  	- low income countries
	- middle income countries

In each case, there is also a table of first stage estimates.


************************************************************************

Each file has 48 columns.  The first 12 columns correspond to 2+ 
estimates, the second 12 to 3+, the third 12 to 4+ and the final 12 to 
5+. Within each of these rows of 12, we are estimating for four 
different outcome variables (in order: School Z-Score, No Education, 
Child Mortality, and Infant Mortality).  For each outcome there are 
three columns.  The first only includes age controls, the second 
adds education controls, and the third adds health controls.

In case it's clearer as a list, each file looks like this:
01-12 Two Plus
      01-03 School Z-Score
      04-06 No Education
      07-09 Child Mortality
      10-12 Infant Mortality

13-24 Three Plus
      13-15 School Z-Score
      16-18 No Education
      19-21 Child Mortality
      22-24 Infant Mortality

25-36 Four Plus
      25-27 School Z-Score
      28-30 No Education
      31-33 Child Mortality
      34-36 Infant Mortality

37-48 Five Plus
      37-39 School Z-Score
      40-42 No Education
      43-45 Child Mortality
      46-48 Infant Mortality
