Q1) Coefficient on mother's age
    > I made a very silly mistake that's managed to go through
      on a global that was defined a long time ago...
    > Here mother's age was age at time of survey so is
      clearly not the variable that we want.  I've corrected
      this and all results in terms of health and educ are
      similar
    > We're not currently controling for bord in these regressions.
      In the past we've discussed whether to do this and decided
      not to.  I have run in the past with bord and things are
      similar.  I can rerun very quickly if you think this is best.

Q2) Constant and points re twin regression
    > Twin is rescaled as 0 or 100 here. 
    > We have retained only twins in all regressions throughout results
    > It's a base case for as you say BMI, height, educ, but also
      a base omitted country.  We are including country fixed effects,
      so I'm not sure how well we can interpret this.

Q3) Anemic variable in Chile and drugs.
    > Yes this is counterintuitive.   CHECK
    > Yes, drugs is an indicator for recreational drug taking (or reporting
      this to surveyers).  There are two levels, as women are asked to classify
      as infrequently or frequently.  For interest, in Chile this drug 
      consumption is overwhelmingly likely to be marijuana, but could also be 
      base paste.

(Q4) You have phrased Altonji exactly correctly.  A value of 2 is actually
a quite similar number to that which they found in their catholic schools
paper I think, and which they cast as quite strong evidence in favour of an
effect.  I guess each case is idiosyncratic as it depends on how well we think 
that our observable variables can explain the outcome variable.

(Q5) The first stage and second stage come from ivreg2, so are defined in 
exactly the same way and with the same controls.  All the controls are exactly 
the same throughout the entire do file. 

(Q6) I have 4+, 5+ and up to 7+ saved on my computer.  I'll send them through.

(Q7) Re the Conley stuff.
     > Yes, estimated gamma from twin is estimated as specified on Conley p. 1
       and is as you say.
     > My notation below was sloppy.  The value for beta just refers to the
       "true" value for gamma listed above.  This gives us some idea about
       how the instrument might be slightly incorrect, which we then feed into
       Conley's method.  The values 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 are just arbitrary multipliers.
       While we expect that just using the "true" value estimated is a pretty good
       guess of what the inconsistency *may* be, I then use a value to see what
       would happen if this estimate of gamma was 1/2, 1, ... times the estimated
       value.

       Conley et al have a series of graphs where they draw confidence intervals
       over a range of values.  If you see the one on the right hand side where
       the confidence interval is flat above and slopes down below, you can think
       of these confidence intervals as what you would see if we just estimated
       at all points between 0 and 2 rather than just .5,1,1.5,2.

       The numbers from the table are estimated by making some assumptions about
       how plausibly exogenous our instrument is.  If we think that twins are a
       perfect instrument, then including twins in:  
       	       school zscore = beta*fert + gamma*twins
       should lead to a gamma of zero.  Imagine for now that we think that the
       worst possible gamma if twins were quite a bad instrument is 0.2 (ie being
       from a twin family gives you .2sd in the schooling distribution).  The, 
       Conley's UCI approach says that we should estimate the 2sls estimate of
       our equation for the range of values [0, 0.2].  We will know then that
       the true confidence interval of our estimate on fertility lies within
       the union of all confidence intervals of these estimates.

       In this case all that's left to us is to define what the maximum gamma
       is (above the arbitrary 0.2 I said).  You suggested that we get this
       by actually estimating the above regression.  In the table above this
       is the first rows of the table (0.0587 for 2+).  If we just use 0.0587
       as our maximum gamma then this is 1*0.0587, so our union of CIs for all
       estimates is [-0.1341, 0.0120].  We are thus 95% sure that the effect of
       fertility on school zscore lies between these values.  The uppermost value
       is the upper bound for the case where gamma=0, and the lowermost is the 
       lower bound for the case where gamma=0.0587.
       
       Rather than just calculate for the one value I calculated for four possible
       maximum gammas.  These are just 0.5*0.0587, 1*0.0587, 1.5*0.0587 and
       2*0.0587.  If you joined each of the upper and lower bound points they
       would look something like the graph on the right of figure XX in Conley et
       al's paper.
