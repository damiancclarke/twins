Hi Sonia,

Now that all these regressions have finished running, my comments are below.
The general impression is that there is *some* evidence that there may be a Q-Q
tradeoff, but that this is still somewhat weak.  The inclusion of education and
health controls helps.  When including twins there is major evidence in favour
of Q-Q (in line with Rosenzweig & Zhang), but this isn't really surprising.  
Finally, the desired threshold regressions are very noisy - I think because of
 the selection into the threshold group.

More detailed comments on each specification are below.  These are all 
extensions of the original table 14. 

Base Q-Q:
	> Test for 4 variables (school zscore, Pr(no educ), child mortality, infant
		mortality)
	> In every case (48 regs), the sequential addition of education and health 
		controls moves coefficients more in the direction of a Q-Q tradeoff
	> Frequently though, the difference is not significant
	> A number of times the Q-Q tradeoff *does* turn up when adding additional
	  controls (particularly the case for Z-Score, which is I think our variable
	  with most variation
	> First stage of twin on fertility is about 0.8 for twin on 2nd birth to 0.9
		for twin on 5th birth.  This is higher than Angrist et al (0.5-0.6 on 2 and
		3 in Israel), and slightly higher than Black et al (0.7-0.8 on 2,3 in 
		Norway 1986-2000)

Base Q-Q with twins:
	> Same pattern as above, but find a considerable Q-Q tradeoff in most cases, 
		and this is most apparent when controlling for maternal health and 
		education
	> First stage is essentially the same as above (same sample plus twins and 
		next child in singleton families

Base Q-Q by income level:
	> Doesn't add that much really.  Hard to see much of a difference between 
		either low or middle income and the base model
	> First stage is higher in low income countries, but this is no longer the
		case when conditioning on education and maternal health

Q-Q with interaction for desired
	> A lot going on.  
	> For low fertility (2+) fert*threshold actually makes kids better
	> For higher fertility, fert*threshold does find Q-Q tradeoff
	> This is a selected sample, as threshold is only switched on for those who
		wanted 2 (or 3 or 4 or 5) kids, while comparison is with all families
	> This also turns up in first stage.  For 2+ group, twin*threshold is 
		negative, for 3+, about same as rest, and for 5+ is considerably greater than 1
