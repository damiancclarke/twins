(1) Code estimates for effect of twins on outcomes *before* twins were born.  This is an alternative test to whether twin families are different to non-twin families.
(2) Code Conley's imperfect IV estimates.  There are four of these - three look similar, the Bayesian is the most different, and I think we need to determine our prior for gamma
(3) Angrist T3 and T5
(4a) What fraction of families with twins at parity 2 (who have at least 3 children) state a preference for 2 children? (and similarly for 3+ etc).
(4b) what fraction of the families that have not had twins have actual fertility>stated fertility
(4c) what fraction of families with twins at parity 2 end up having more than 3 children (and similarly for 3+ etc)
(5) Sex selection instruments
(6) Robustness checks for 2 stages of regression without using truncated fertility (>35 year old mothers, >40 year old mothers)
(7) Generate results for just twins (rather than twins+pretwins).  See description in Sonia's word doc
(8) Include dummy for assisted delivery/prenatal care

-- if completed fert shows similar 1st stage as truncated fert then we can use truncated fert although for the paper (you can delay this) we should show this robustness check in 2sls ie we shd show the 1st and 2nd stage results for the women who have completed fert




ORDER - 2013/01/05 11:07 onwards
(1) descriptive statistics including who hits desired fert by twinning (see note below)
    * % underweight
    * % anemia
    * % short (less than 5 ft 2)
    * distribution of these
(2) Angrist table 3
(3) Angrist table 5 (?) this is a lot of regs
(4) Conley gamma estimates - OLS to show gamma


(5) Add antenatal care and midwife in area to twin regs
(7) Put together tables
    * summary stats X 3 (old, desired fert, vars of interest)
    * 




Thx Damian 
I think old tables are redundant now? 
Best if paper is very linear / focused 
So this is what we need 
--- many desc stats tables and graphs - some as before but also new ones suggested yesterday -  I can help make a list later today
    2 slides focusing desc stats to our 2 points : 
Show percent women in sample who are underweight , short (less than 5 foot 2 inch??) and have anemia. Can show distrib of these var.
Then  spell out coef on health indic in the reg that is our next table (so these 2 slides come after the table indicated below). 
    Slide on desired fert can show it's distrib; then by parity the percent of cases in which actual exceeds desired with and without twins. Also see yesterday's list in doc file
------ reg of twins on mother characteristics if we have time then including avail of antenatal care and midwife in mothers village. Dhs and chile. We shd later add uk USA Scandinavia regs
----- the altonji-taber est of role of unobs  with the algebra shown and interpretation explicit . An I right that the ratio we found allows us to say that the role of unobs is large? 
----- 1st stage like angrist t3 making sure controls are identical to those in 2nd stage. With and without inter with threshold dummy 
      Repeat above with women age 35 plus 
------2sls estim like angrist table 5 
Alongside we need ols est of identical specs to 2sls
Ideally resukts show that ols coef gets less neg and 2sls coef more neg when we add first educ and then health controls
Also coef on threshold times twins shd be negative 
------ table showing IMR test of exog
If we can't figure it out then for now we show only estim with no controls for moth ht
In order this shd be before our 1st stage just after reg of twins on family x var
----- table showing Conley 
Show ols of eq 1 in Conley which gives gamma estimate
Then show clearly the bounds procedure and estim

The Rubinstein paper got results with small n in nlsy
So if we have enough pre and post cohorts and u have duflos code which includes province level pre program enrolment rates then doing 2sls for pre and post school construction cohorts (by gender if duflo finds only girl effects?) would beef up the story. It may help us explain the absence of trade off

If Indonesia now is too complicated then can instead do 2sls on old and young cohorts in Dhs sample
There was wave of making prim school first and then secondary school free 
I think wave started 90s will check 
In which years are our sample cohorts of school age ?


If you still have time then generate main results for very poor vs other countries and boys vs girls 
It's clumsy on train maybe there are some other gems we have to show 
Its hard to find stretch of time to focus on one paper when many in parallel so if we can get this advanced it will help us move fwd it's been long but I think we are now in the path
