    hi Damian
    sorry it has taken me so long, it is because i knew i had to spend a while typing this up!
    here are some reactions to the recent twins pdf.
    now that i've written them up i wish i'd done this in word so i could format it properly for you but have to rush now sorry do ask if ia m unclear
    For all tables- check notes, often not complete or consistent.
    In notes indicate sample used, cohort range, which DHS survey years, any restrictions. indicate when sample changes.



     

    T9: shows desired fert and (actual minus desired fert) are correlated with mother charactersitcs. so this is bad news. i thought we had a better result earlier? Pl could you clarify exact defs in notes to this table of the 3 dep vars, not sure how you define shortfall and twin-threshold.
    T55&6: main results- 2nd stage of IV- starting here as this is the core table-
    Clarify that in T5, outcomes are for first born children. correct? State this in table notes. similarly for T6. 
    It is unclear whether estimates from Row 3 onwards (low/ middle etc) are with or without bord?
    ​ Without bord.  Generally this doesn't make too much of a difference.  Have added clarification to note.​
    Let's show interaction with desired fert with/without bord and for low and middle income ie let's create a new panel of the table (landscape it) which repeats the entire table with the desired fert interac thrown in.
    ​ Desired fertility seems to work quite well in middle income in terms of signs/magnitudes, but it is never significant (in all of the tests)...  I can add this panel to the table, but it doesn't really tell us very much in support of finding a Q-Q tradeoff.​
    In the Essex jan talk we had one significant coef on the interaction with desired, we lost it, worth checking why?

​Some small changes from presentation at Essex (see slide 30 from Sonia's presentation).  This is due to inclusion of two further (2012) DHS surveys which became available.  I accidentally remade the source data using new DHS data so sample changed a little bit.  I won't do this again so we don't see any more changes in coefficients.  In any case, the significant coefficient was on middle income countries.  The low/mid distinction has changed as the old one was very crude.​

    interaaction in T5 has wrong sign, could you check data and code for desired fert just in case?
    Interpreting coef - see T6- 1st row, coef of -0.042. If mean of dep var is about 0.02 does this mean that an additional child lowers z-score by >200%? seems too large, maybe i am mis interpreting.?

​Mean of depv (zscore) should be 0, and sd should be 1 (right?).  In this case a reduction of 0.042 implies -4.2% of a standard deviation which seems reasonable to me.​
 

    Now 1st row has sig coef in col 2 and 3 (nice) but what changed, we didnt have this earlier?

​Some small changes from presentation at Essex (-0.038** to -0.042** for 3+).  This is due to inclusion of two further (2012) DHS surveys which became available.  I accidentally remade the source data using new DHS data so sample changed a little bit.  I won't do this again so we don't see any more changes in coefficients.

    Can you add a new table for 4+ with similar structure?

​Have added tables for 4+ and 5+ in appendix tables.​
 
 

    High priority- i thought we had these ready but they are not in pdf- we need to show 1st stage eqs.
    style of angrist lavy.
    structure should match main IV results ie need to show with/out bord, low and middle inc, with/out interaction of desired fert etc. just as suggested above.

​Yes, this is included now. [***ADD TABLE NUMBER HERE]​
 

    T4 OLS table shd be consistent with IV table.
    so show (a) interaction with desired threshold
    (b) show pretwins vs (pretwins and twins)
    is this interpretation of coef correct- col. 3, row-1, coef -0.075.
    i look in T1 for mean of d.v. (z score ed) and found this to be ~0.02.
    So does the coef tell us that 1 additional child lowers the z-score from the mean of 0.02 to -0.055 (ie adding -0.075 to the mean score 0.02)? I have a feeling this is not right- can you check and tell me?
    ​I think this is clear from the previous discussion...  The effect sizes are interpreted as standard deviations so -0.055 implies that an additional birth reduces education by 5.5% of a standard deviation.​

 

    Table 7 i need to read Conley again but in case you know offhand -we need to clarify in notes to table and for ourselves how exactly gamma and delta are defined. And check whether these bounds are meant to be compared with OLS beta or IV beta?

​These bounds are interpreted compared to IV beta (Altonji on the other hand is based on OLS).​
 
​ Gamma should be interpreted as describing our prior belief of the sign on twins (the instrument) in the first stage.  In this sense at the point where gamma=0 this is precisely the IV estimate.  Delta describes the maximum gamma that we allow in our calculations (for example, what would happen if we thought that gamma was distributed according to a uniform distribution between say 0 and 0.5?  In this case delta=0.5.)  I think this should all be made clear in either the text or as an appendix.  In the end I had to nearly completely re-write the Conley et al code and made this into a Stata ado so can describe in an appendix and say that it is made available perhaps. ​

    T8: interesting f-m difference. to test if it is significant we need to run a case in which we interact all RHS vars with gender so the t test on the interaction gives us a test of significance.
    Since desired fert is often related to gender of children, repeat T8 using format of T5 ie do it with desired interaction and for low/middle income and for pretwin vs pretwin+twin outcomes. this is equal to repeating T5,6 by gender. 
         So one way to limit the # cols is to add a gender interaction eq as the last col of T5 and 6. for the gender interaction you can use just the final column with all controls? or if it easier just make an extended T8. if tables are in xls we can cut a column from one table and add it to another table later.
        Awkward to list #obs in notes to table 8, better to add a row to the table
    T1- 
    are these means from child or mother level data? clarify in notes. let me know what you think is the best match to regressions but off the cuff i think we should either use mother-level data for all stats 
    ( i think this is better but please check/think as you are at the helm) or use mother-level data for mother stats and child level data for child stats.
    Add a 5th col showing mean (sd) for full sample (single+twin, low+middle income). we need this to interpret coefs in regs on full sample.
    Drop row-1 showing birth order (it is v similar to fertility and we never use the continuous var in our regs).
    Just above "mother char", add a row showing birth order of the twins for the twin families ie col. 2 and 4 will have values, 1 and 3 blank
    Under Mother char, add summ stats for (desired fert> threshold fert)
    for consistency replace "Ideal fam size" with "Desired fam size"
    Childrens outcomes: clarify is those summ stats are for pre-twins or all children? i suggest producing those stats for pre-twins in col. 1 and 3 and for twins in col. 2 and 4; what do you think?
    T2-
    mother and father educ values look inconsistent with means in T1? twin moth and fath should be more not less educ?
    as in T1 indicate in notes whether you use mother or child level data to conduct tests of balance. here i would use mother-level data.
    You have a bunch of vars below mother-height which should be in T1 -?
    vars in T1 and T2 shd be matched eg BMI in T1 should be pr(low BMI) as in T2. 
    in fact i suggest that in T1 and T2 and in regresssions we omit the normal bmi category and include/show low-bmi and high-bmi (obese)
    let's not use #antenatal checks at indiv level as it is very endogenous. either use some indicator of antenantal care availability at psu or distt level or just drop it
    T3 title Test of hypothesis that women who bear twins have better prior health
    notes shd define "treated 2+" etc, and should explain how sample for these regs is constructed, which cohorts are incl, and refer another table for what base and +S&H means.
    Prob (twin) by birth order (fig 1) - create histogram so can read off prob for 1, 2, 3..etc
    Similarly fig 2: histogram showing % families of each type (twin/ not) with 1, 2, 3.. births.
    Fig 30 don't code "up to god " and "non numeric" as 10+. Drop these. Make a category 9+ which are genuine 9+s
    Revisit Chile eq for pr(twin) on our slides. 
    add clear notes on variable definitions in that table; add table of mean (sd) for those vars
    Present the vars in tables in 2 sets: those determined before conception eg height of woman and those after eg smoking.
    many thanks damian. s
